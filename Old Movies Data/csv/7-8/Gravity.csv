Anyway, how the fuck did these Mexican directors won Oscar for Best Director while influential directors like Stanley Kubrick and Alfred Hitchcock never did?",1,true,3,,,,,,

First the hospital/anaesthetists said nothing went wrong. Then the consultant anaesthetist (my call to him in desperation) said it was 'awareness' (meaning what's usually called anaesthetic awareness in the UK or unintended intra-operative awareness in the USA). Then this same man at the end of a farcical meeting said I had experienced 'emergence phenomenon' - but decided not to tell me what that was. Then in response to my letter of complaint the Chief exec wrote that nothing went wrong and didn't use any name for what had occurred - supposedly just my abnormal response to normal events. They contacted my GP and told him something but I asked him and he refused to tell me what he had been told. He said at one point 'they didn't know what went wrong' - but of course they must have = a lie. You'd think (with all their expensive legal expertise paid for by clients/users of their services = us) they'd have created and stuck to one coherent and consistent story wouldn't you? Yup: suffocation is a terrible way to die and many of us will die in this way. It is utter HELL. I survived it but others have died and will die in hospital because of medical errors by anaesthetists, surgeons, operating department practitioners (ODPs), nurses, recovery room staff etc. A weekend so no senior staff on-site, agency nurses, poor training for all concerned, arrogance, incompetence, misdiagnosis,not listened to or believed (before and after)...

When you orbit near the blackhole's event horizon, you'll notice time getting slower because of the increase of gravitational pull. And then when you look at Earth from the side of a black hole, you'll noticed everything on Earth changing rapidly as if you're forwarding a video tape (less gravity, faster time). So when you come back to Earth (after marking several orbits around the black hole), you won't age much while your peers on Earth are either dead or grew very old.",0

Second, I'm sick of seeing people comparing this film to Interstellar and arguing about which one is better. Thats like comparing apples to oranges and arguing about which fruit is better. But in all seriousness, Gravity got a bigger opening, a better Cinemascore, better reviews, more oscar nominations, more oscar wins, and a bigger box office than Interstellar. And Interstellar had no 3D. Interstellar and Gravity are two completely different movies! Also Interstellar was a stupid movie. I saw it on cable. It had way too much plot holes I mean it focused way to much on planet jumping. And it focused on love way too much. It was like watching Twilight in space only worse. Also the acting was terrible. I like Anne Hathaway but she should have never done that movie. Same with Matt Damon and Michael Caine. It doesn't help that Matthew Macaunhey was in it. His movies aren't good. I rather watch like 4 Justin Bieber music videos than sit through Interstellar again. Its no wonder Big Hero 6 did better than Interstellar when it came out. Plus Big Hero 6 was THE better movie. Gravity on the other hand was a masterpiece. It had better acting, a better story, better effects and it had the best 3D since Avatar. Its one of the best movies to watch in a theater. Sandra Bullock was great in it. Plus Gravity got a better tomato meter score than Interstellar. On Cinemascore, Gravity got an A while Interstellar got like a B+.

Really? Also, Interstellar is not nearly as scientific as a lot of people pretend.

It would take many hours (up to twenty) if the debris headed straight for Earth, which it likely wouldn't. The whole ""chain reaction"" scenario is also abject bullshit. Satellites aren't lined up in a single orbit distance and also not on a single path like dominoes. And even worse, they play into the ridiculous and patently unrealistic cool, chilled out male saves helpless woman bullshit. It's about time we left that tripe behind in the Edwardian/Victorian Era stories where it belonged. NASA's own studies on Mars mission simulations, as well as those conducted by the Chinese and the Europeans, all demonstrated that women do much better in extremely stressful situations than men. Yeah, it's Hollywood and an obviously fictional story, but ffs... It was painful as fuck as an educated person to watch that bullshit.",1

There is a different premise for both films. Try and remember this. The only similarity of both these films is the setting, which is space. And that is all. Gravity, a lady who is trying to return to earth. Interstellar, people that are trying to leave earth. Can't you see? Over all, for a film, I would like to watch what is entertaining, and of that I choose Interstellar. Interesting plot, interesting premise, character development, more emotional instances. If I would like to watch a more down to earth film, which bases more on plot situation more that any other element, then its Gravity. And if you notice, the film is in real-time. Everything happens in almost 90 minutes or so. The film is also more believable and laid back. You just watch what happens. For Interstellar, you have to think in order to get the gist of the movie, and it looks like a handful of people were having trouble with that. But Gravity is missing the awe, the ""what if"" and imagination, stepping out the comfort zone. So the aim of both films are different. But I'll say this.

Let us get one thing straight . Gravity is a good movie , Is it the best sci_fi I have ever seen ? Absolutely not . did it break the mould ? yeah somehow , but not necessarily because of its presentation or ideas , but more because most of the sci_fi people watch nowadays are so mainstream they mostly worship action , cliches and aliens . gravity in all its essence is really a very simple story about survival . something more akin to cast away than star wars . If gravity was a book , then it would be a short story , not a novel . Back story that is so important in character arcs is not fully exposed on purpose (they could have used flashbacks for example but they didn't) , all you need to know about sandra bullock 's character is that her daughter died , and that she has been living in sorrow ever since .They never fully explored the main character for a few reasons . This is my interpertation of course : Firstly they wanted you to be fully invested in the setting as much as possible , and secondly maybe they thought it would be a tad melodramatic and cliched . Visually speaking , the film is stunning , that every scene so painstakingly crafted is a story in its own . Gravity is not only a simple story favouring symbolism over conventional storytelling but also a visual experience that makes up for its lack of dialogue through prestine , thought provoking imagery that will haunt your dreams for how lonely and dark space can be , yet so beautiful and endless that it would take your breath away . That is why it is so crafty , a single frame can make up for thousands of lines . That is why so many adore this movie . My brother who is a very hard to please kind of person thought it a perfect movie and gave it a 10 . It depends really on your kind of personality . He saw in its simplicity and hauntingly beautiful imagery a story in its own . He loved clooney 's nobelity and liked bulock's fight for survival . But that didn't make it the best movie i ever saw . Yeah the visuals enhanced the atmosphere dramatically and yeah I liked clooney's character . I just never felt for sandra bullock's character . Maybe I demanded more backstory , maybe the role needed a lesser known actress , I just don't know . Visual imagery was indeed striking but iam one of those people that far favors emotional investment in my stories over gorgeous visual imagery . Simple strorytelling is a double edged sword in movies , and lack in character backstory would have been forgiven if i was emotionaly invested in the fight or if the premise was more original , but neither was the case . But as i said before , gravity is more than the sum of its parts , and I try to understand as much as i can, why people like it so much . It is just that I can't totally adore it or see it as a flawless movie as other people do .",1,false,0,,,,,,

I am trying to maintain the peace between two YouTube members by choosing not to argue with you. PLUS, I've already told you this at least twice: I. Do not. Understand. The point in your argument. Why is that so difficult to understand? Maybe if you would just stop being so vague, resort to mind games, and stop making stupid claims that the other person who doesn't want to argue with you is just ""shirking away from their side of the argument,"" somebody WOULD HAPPILY engage in a nice, friendly debate with you over this film. But all you've chosen to say is, ""That's sad that you didn't know what I meant when I said that one thing about the thing."" Because of this, I haven't understood a lick of what you're getting at. You have pressed the trivial argument of whether Gravity was good or not for so long, and for so heatedly, I've just eyebrowed you funny for the past few weeks. That's why I haven't replied back. It's been nearly a month. Get over it that some people don't want to talk to people who treat others in this fashion. If you keep on harrasing people to fight back with you when they don't want to, nobody is going to reply to you. I'm a good example of this. If it'll make you leave me alone, I will now ""defend my side of the argument,"" since you keep on begging for me to do so. Did you mean, ""that's sad that you didn't know what I meant when I said, ""everything blowing up was the only thing that makes this movie good?"" XD "" Because if THAT'S what you were getting at, all that does is just show me that people today who play way too many video games are way too easily entertained by things blowing up. BOOM! EXPLOSION! PRETTY LIGHTS! Explosions are a very cheap form of entertainment. A director is going to need more substance to a film than that for it to be good. That's right. I said good. There are two different types of good in regards to motion pictures: the kind of good that lacks meaning, substance, and meaningful characters, yet it still mysteriously entertains people somehow... (Twilight is an excellent example), and the kind of good that is entertaining, well-written, and has good characters. (Classics like Star Wars and 2001: A Space Odyessy are good examples of this). Gravity unfortunately... IN MY OPINION... happens to be the former. THAT is why I don't particularly care for this movie. Lots of explosions don't equal quality. Whoever thinks this... makes me sad. Do you understand why I don't like this movie, now? As for ""cardboard characters,"" I have a feeling that that's NOT what you meant by, ""that was the only thing that made this movie good!"" Therefore, I won't go there. That is why I asked, ""So you like cardboard characters?"" But our opinions differ ABOUT A MOVIE. (Not religion, not politics). In the past few weeks, I have learned from you as a person that you rather keep on harrassing somebody to argue with you who doesn't want to, and just choose to make outrageous accusations at them about their true motives for not doing so. THAT is sad. Not me ""not getting what you meant."" But your accusation doesn't matter anymore, because I've already explained my side. Therefore, you have no further reason to once again harrass for me to ""explain myself."" So now, there's nothing left for me to do but be the wiser individual. Something this trivial will not escalate into something stupid. You are most certainly right. This is over. Sidenote: You're welcome for the correction in your spelling of ""you're welcome.""",0

I did not see this in the theater because I knew the scenes would make me dizzy and uncomfortable. I just watched it last night on a large screen TV, and it was over hyped, over rated and no way deserved Oscars except for the SFX. Just as many had observed when it was released it had no plot, no character development, lots of impossible events to swallow, but it was also BORING as hell when there was no explosions or fast flying astronauts to watch, Bullock fiddling with buttons and trying to grab onto parts of the satellites put me to sleep. In the Sci-Fi and Horror genres you have to be able to suspend disbelief when it comes to storyline, you mean to tell me that Dr. Bullock was able to get into a Chinese spacecraft and go 'eny, meny, miny, moe' and pick the right buttons to push to land her safely in the water of earth? 2001 A Space Odyssey it is not, which is why it is being quickly forgotten. Another example of special effects over story and performance. Cloney was the stereotyped tragic hero, and had to do the 'let me die to save you' cliche, Sandra was nominated for an Oscar for going 'uhhh, oh, help, need air, uh, oh, ah' for an hour'?",42,true,93,,,,,,

At first when reading this strand of comments I considered putting up argument against you, but you don't seem intelligent enough to comprehend most of it when you can't understand basic concepts like fiction compared to science fiction. You also seem delighted to jump onto whatever aggressive fanatic stance possible. Like mentioning your atheist beliefs out of nowhere. It's nearly deranged and not at all a sound argument. That's not an opinion. That's just a fact, mate. You should greatly consider sedatives and therapy. Past that, to OP; Nice review. It seems like many writers are becoming excruciatingly lazy. Even in other films that are science fiction and take place 'in the not to distant future'-- Many writers don't seem to take the effort to research what they are writing about or do any real character development. It's depressing when a populace is satisfied by a movie merely by it's special effects work and nothing else. When these movies do well it means that people have become overgrown babies pawing at the sparkly flashy things in front of them, but purposefully without desire to comprehend what they clap and giggle for.

She has literally nothing to live for and I think the film executed that very well. It definitely has problems (and I really don't care about the scientific inaccuracies). And I too would've preferred a darker ending, particularly since it's Alfonso Cuaron who made Y Tu Mama Tambien and Children of Men. But I guess this was made as a life affirming film, a very optimistic story. It's certainly not perfect but it's a brilliant film and the people dismissing it as ""all spectacle very simple plot"" don't seem to realise that sometimes simplicity can also be poetry. Think of it this Gravity is story that would've worked only in this medium. It it was a book, it would've sucked. It it was a theatre play, it would've sucked.

I liked the movie, amazing soundtracks and effects ( they even created a real black hole in 3d softwares just for some shots, a thing that was never done before ). Besides all this, the whole story feels kinda unreal. Also, I feel like Christopher Nolan was not in charge of the screenplay in this movie...because what he did in the action scenes of ""The Dark Knight"" was terrific. ( not in the positive way ). Gravity is different from these two. The story is kinda more believable. It has great soundtracks and great effects too but what I liked the most was that atmosphere of loneliness and emptyness, and those amazing camera shots which are some of the bests I've ever seen in a movie. The first shot is almost 14 minutes long and that is just unbelievable. An incredibly big amount of effort and time was needed to do just that one shot. No wonder why Alfonso Cuarón worked 4 years and a half to make the this movie... Anyways, If you like space, you will like all these movies.

Gravity is a more emotionally intense movie, and will do a good job of making you feel like you're floating in space. Both films are visually and musically spectacular. I personally enjoyed Gravity's musical score and art direction more, and Interstellar's plot more. The science of Interstellar is a mix of real physics, alongside some speculative physics, particularly toward the end. The drought on Earth is also unrealistic. However, the astral physics is done superbly: you get to see what a black hole actually looks like, what a wormhole would look like, the time dilation effects, etc. Some of the individual frames were calculated by a supercomputer running for days long, and the results were used in two academic papers. Interstellar's plot is extremely convoluted, almost paradoxical, but it all technically fits with no inconsistencies if you think about it, and if you buy the speculative plot devices. However, I did not buy Interstellar emotionally. Much of the characterization seemed forced and some of the character personalities were inconsistently developed. Many people will disagree with me on this. The emotional scenes were hit and miss for me, but drama is more subjective. Gravity's physics tries to be as realistic as possible, but they got some things wrong. For example, the satellites are going round the Earth in the wrong direction. However, most of the floating around is very well done; Buzz Aldrin said it looked pretty much like how it actually looked when they were floating in the vessel. The main conflict is a problem that could actually happen in real life, but they ignore the fact that satellites travel at different relative speeds, making most of the plot technically impossible. Gravity's plot is straightforward but relies on incredible coincidences, which could shake your suspension of disbelief. However, this does not mean Gravity is a ""stupid"" film. Many scenes have nice artistic touches, obvious symbolism, etc. The music is very inventive and designed to replace sound because there's no sound in space. The direction is also top-notch, and makes you feel stranded in space. It is a beautiful film. Overall, Interstellar is the better film if you want to think, be puzzled, and have your imagination stirred, in the classic science fiction sense. Gravity is the better film if you want to have an emotionally gripping artistic ""experience"" of space. They are both amazing films. I usually go for complex plots and films that make me think, but in this case Gravity moved me more, I was disoriented and on the edge of my seat through most of it. The two films compliment each other.",0

James (writer of 50 Shades of Grey. If you've even read a paragraph of that book you could tell how cheesy the writing is) is a better writer. Even though that's still you opinion, movies, books, etc, generally have a pattern that makes them considered better or worse than other movies, or books, etc. So, obviously, I'm basing Gravity to other modern movies. If you read critic's responses they reviewed the movie as 1) having very impressive graphics 2) applause on sound effects 3) horribly overused cliches 4) for anybody who knows anything about science or even momentum, really, really annoyingly unrealistic object mechanics and unreal-ism (in half of the movie it's like she's falling, when in real life there would be no reason for her to fall because she's floating in micro-gravity, and a single tug is enough, you won't keep on falling in a direction as soon as you stop moving). and 5) cheesy acting; it's a miracle that she got an award, noted even by critics, yes, since she had very little professional acting needed, aside from panting in the movie (she doesn't even have 50 lines in the movie). I'm not hating, I'm just saying, that opinion is not what makes a movie bad or good, it's what determines preference; maybe you do or don't like movies about space; maybe you like the effects or maybe you don't.

Gravity lacked almost any plot, and had very little actual acting. It also used cliches for the hell of using them in a movie, in places where they were not only completely unnecessary, but where in real life if an even like this happened the solution would have been easily solvable. It's not unknown that the movie was directed poorly. It's the special effects that was what grabbed attention. Do I have to repeat everything I'm saying or are you gonna stop arguing by saying this is my opinion. It is my opinion, obviously, but opinion doesn't mean that all judgement is irrational, which is what I hear coming from your side. A better opinion comes from rational thinking and observation. In other words, if you make an opinion without having reason or rationale, then that opinion is less useful to others than an opinion that is backed by an opinion which is based on constructive criticism. This is something that is important to know if life and you'll find it true eventually in life regardless, but just for future reference. Also no hate or anything, so I'm not saying you can't like the movie, I'm just giving my perspective and explaining it, that doesn't mean that you can't disagree with me or anything.

What frustrates me is people that believe that the events in Gravity can happen in real life--also it's very far-fetched to say what goes on in Interstellar was ""based on Einstein's theories"", that's like saying a movie about race cars is based on Newton's theories, and not even, because all it has to do with Einstein's theories is the fact that it takes place in space, and everything after, is the opposite of ""Einstein's theories"". But more importantly, it makes me really upset when people say that the events in Gravity could happen in real life because that is extremely far from the truth. The physics in Gravity are frustratingly horrid and false that throughout the whole movie I was laughing/facepalming at the crap physics. Also, if it was possible for what happened in Gravity to happen in real life, the Kessler Syndrom would be an event that destroyed the Space Age as soon as it started. People who aren't devoted to orbital mechanics and rocket science really don't have a proper understanding of the fact that for something like what happened in Gravity to happen would first of all require something to travel exactly in the right place at the exact right time at exactly the right relative velocity, and what you have to really take into account is that if something like that were to happen, it would have to get to the exact altitude at the right place during it's suborbital period (and you have to take into account the fact that the debris was equivalent to a dozen full-sized rockets, if you include first stages) and even if an explosion at the exact right time in an orbit did happen there would be a million-to-one chance that the rocket would get within a hundred miles in the vicinity of the hundreds of satellites currently in orbit. Another thing to take into account is that because of how the ISS orbits the earth, and it's altitude, and inclination, etc, we can only launch rockets to the ISS on very specific times of the day on specific days of the month (there are about 5 or so of those a month). Also there's the fact that the stuff when completely unnoticed in direction, and suddenly, oh yeah apparently the debris that was not going to hit you changed trajectory somehow and is going to hit you in under five minutes, all of the debris magically changed trajectory and is headed directly at you, within the vicinity of 0.1 kilometers. AND the fact that it hit BOTH the Space Shuttle AND the ISS in two different rounds, THEN there's the Chinese Space Station which was magically flying at almost the same trajectory as the ISS within about 5 miles of it, same with the Space Shuttle. Anybody who has even played a little bit of Kerbal Space Program, by the way, is laughing at the screen and saying that everything that I'm saying is so fucking obvious (on a sidenote, btw, Kerbin is a hundred times smaller in surface area than Earth, so now imagine the same scenario on Earth). So basically, the only way an encounter like that could happen in real life even remotely is if Russia sent up two rounds of 20 explosive filled rockets side by side at a perfect trajectory to hit the ISS AND the Space Shuttle in advance, while apparently knowing exactly where the Space Shuttle is going to be, AND even then they would only have an accuracy range of about 5-10 kilometers without further correction burns, which if was pulled off, completely undetected, Russia would have spent over 200 million dollars on that many rockets and shrapnel-producing explosives. Oh, plus the 500+ million dollars Russia/USSR spent on making the ISS. P.S. who remembers the 200 character count on YouTube? 'm I right? XD",1

""Critical thinking is the intellectually disciplined process of actively conceptualizing, applying, analyzing, synthesizing, and/or evaluating information gathered from, or generated by, observation, experience, reflection, reasoning, or communication, as a guide to belief and action."" Second-hand information isn't always negative. The conditions differ based on the subject matter at hand, you don't apply the same premise to everything. An example would be your LSD argument. Drugs are scientific; factual; objective. The effects they have aside, we can assert whether they're physically good for you. Movies, on the other hand, are much more subjective. You form your opinions on movies firstly and primarily through observation, experience and reflection (see above). Especially if you're planning to criticize it, watching the movie is the very first step. I really don't care what you think about the movie or whether you can be bothered to watch it due to what you delude yourself you know about it. That's none of my business, it's your problem entirely. However, you don't throw your pseudo-criticism on people who may actually be thinking about watching it when you haven't yourself. That, my friend, is the epitome of hypocrisy and stupidity. Which leads us to the next part of what I was going to address. Characterizing people through the internet is actually easier than characterizing people in real life. It's in no way prejudice, and therefore has nothing to do with this conversation. People take comfort in internet anonymity and are more likely to voice true views and opinions; that's how anonymity works. Admittedly you don't know who the person is, but you can easily characterize their online handle based on what they type in a comment box. Feels like trying to reason with a 15 year old.",1

What's the point of a trailer? To entice people to watch the movie, and to give people a taste of what it has to offer. He clearly wasn't enticed by what is arguably a pertinent point: there is no sound in space, stated clearly in the beginning of the trailer, yet the trailer then happily showcases audible sounds and explosions in space. Based on this alone, one could logically conclude this movie doesn't care about getting its own rules and boundaries straight, and based on that alone, one can legitimately criticize the movie, and avoid seeing it. So the audio was added to the trailer? So? What was the point? To mislead people looking for loud explosions to watch the movie? What? So they would then be disappointed? Plenty of people judge movies by their trailers. Plenty of people judge books by their covers. It's called natural instinct. That's why we have a saying to not judge books by their covers; doing so is NOT natural to us. You are basically faulting him for being human, for being dependent on his natural instincts, instead of being a logical robot. ""This right here is what's wrong with the world"". How nice; apparently judging movies by their trailers is ""what's wrong with the world"". Come down from your ivory tower, Mr Condescending Know-it-all. Oh, and stating that him making such a comment is ""what's wrong with the world"", proceeding to equate his ""worthless"" opinion as ""stupidity"" and ""bullshit"", saying he is making himself look ""like a complete tool"", and that arguing with him is ""like trying to reason with a 15 year old"" (oh, let's insult all 15-year-olds now!), is indeed being hostile and is insulting to any normal individual.

They even classify a movie like GRAVITY as Sci-Fi only because it took place in Earth's orbit, not nowing that crew of Apollo 11 and 13 had 10 times more problems than Sandra Bullock and Clooney in this movie, but to them, that's a Sci-FI, but Die Hard, Mission Impossible etc are not Sci-Fi movies because they are not in orbit LOL, oh God...how patetic time is this we are living in today... hope you get the point.

I thought Cuaron and Lubezki did magnificent, they took control of the film and gave an intense and dramatic atmosphere, meanwhile, the story was irrelevant because there wasn't new but it wasn't about the story at all. It was about the atmosphere and the characters, particularly, Bullock's. Though many of you think Sandra was just whining, i beg to differ. Yes she was whining but it was damn necessary! She showed an amazing portrayal of a torn woman who's been hurt deeply and afraid to feel pain again but eventually got back on her feet and started to live again. Of course it was only possible with George's character and even though some of you might say he was cut off early, I think the time given in him was just enough.

How likely is it that debris from one destroyed satellite hits the Hubble space telescope, the ISS, several other satellites and a Chinese space station too? Multiple times, over multiple passes. This movie goes from one suspenseful moment to another, to another, to another, to another and to yet another. After awhile I found myself rolling my eyes every time something went wrong. The suspense was fake and manufactured, I can only pretend to be genuinely concerned for the main character's life so many times before I get desensitized, because who am I kidding, she's not going to die, that'd compromise the feel good moment at the end when she feels reborn and happy to be alive! Can't have that. Having said that, this movie did genuinely have me tearing up in the quiet moments between the flashy special effects and explosions, only to pull me right back out of the movie again with another moment I'm expected to get all tense over again. Dialogue is a bit corny too, but I'm not really a person who cares so much about that. I'd probably give it a 3 or 4 out of 10. If you're not too critical of movies and like allot of suspense in your films, then you'll probably really like this, because in essence it's not a bad film, it's just cheap and pandering, which some people are into.",1,true,11,,,,,,

Imagine a man floating in space. He does not have any type of propulsion system such as a jet-pack or boosters. He has an umbrella made of Kevlar which is spread open and tethered to his waistline. The tether is several meters in length, is strength rated for towing, and is fully extended so that a tug on the umbrella will in turn be kinetically transferred to the man, via the tether. The man has a wrist rocket sling shot strapped to his forearm and wrist that is in prime position for firing. He has attached to his chest a pouch full of lead ball weights, each weighing about 3 ounces. The man loads a lead ball into the sling shot and fires it at near full capacity into the concave side of umbrella (now you know why the umbrella is made of Kevlar ;). The momentum of the travelling lead ball is transferred into the umbrella and the umbrella moves slightly in the same direction the ball had been travelling, thereby causing the man to move in the same direction as well. As he fires one shot after another into the umbrella, the speed at which he traverses space increases with each shot. When the man runs out lead balls to fire from his sling shot, he reels in the umbrella- which now retains the entire contents of his ammunition pouch. After retrieving all of the ammunition from the umbrella and placing each ball back into the ammunition pouch attached to his chest, he can now push the umbrella away from him in any direction he chooses, and can again begin the process of his sling shot powered propulsion system.",0,false,0,,,,,,

But imo it wasn't too successful. Space Odyssey - yeah, it's sci-fi but idea itself was similar and no wonder it's classic. This one didn't have that feeling, there you felt such a stranger in a world in which you have little chances to stay alive. For example, why there was so much sound in space? Scenes in space should have been in silence, just with people talking. Why did Sandra's character was counting on luck then she was pushing buttons in chinese station? I know she was on stress but they showed her as if she counted on luck with that mini miny mo bs rather using logic. All in all she supposed to be professional and have some basic psychological training to avoid ""mini miny mo"" as a way to stay alive. Oh, and I loved how she was hanging on that station before entering. Trailer showed explosions and action, so it isn't surprise that people expected more action, explosions in actual movie. And overall those moments then she was alone was boring. There was almost no narrative, only doing actions. Basically we don't learn too much about her character. Yeah, the situation was you had too save your ass, not remembering great moments of your life, but there was a way to show those things. For example it could be done while she was talking with Chinese man in chinese station. It's like they tried to mix action with psychological moments. No wonder it lasted less than 90 minutes. Not saying that movie is bad but it was overrated. With more character development, without hurry to start tragedy happening, trying to focus on that things rather showing her superhero-like abilities while hanging on flying station while avoiding debris, with less sound in space, it would be much better, it doesn't matter it had some great moments.",0

First of all, stop mixing hypothesis and theory. Secondly, I'm not talking about theoretical physics. Previously, since the 1960s we basically assumed that the Big Bang probably occurred from quantum fluctuations, which has to do with the ""splitting"" (sort-of but not exactly--this is actually a famous 'feature' known popularly about quantum mechanics) of a particle into two exact identical particles that are still a single particle. This is not really explaining it, but that's the direct cause (I will leave a couple sources you can read below). What's different now is that we have actually showed that this is in fact, possible, whereas before, that was not the case. We have yet to search more rigorously into this theory (being careful on the definition of 'theory'; I DON'T mean hypothesis), however now there is mathematical evidence that suggests that the scenario is plausible, and there isn't anything to suggest otherwise, either.

I will take the time and explain it to you: As a person who is very interested in physics, space, programming (you know logical stuff) I was really happy that they made a movie about space flight, the dangers of space and I thought they put a decent effort into physics in space and try to make it as realistic as possible, so I went to watch that movie. It turned out that they paid millions in the making of this movie but couldn't spend 100 $ for a physiscs student to tell them how the physics of space work. There are many, many things that can go wrong in space. Actually, just one tiny part of a former satelite can destroy an entire space station if you have bad luck. But they had to come up with this debris-cloud shit which expands within 2 hours to a size that cannot be avoided. Nearly everything in this movie is just wrong. Really, really wrong. There are at least 10 big mistakes, just to name a few: Logic fails: - Scientific personell are not instructed how to operate shuttles or pods. That's what pilots are for. - Even if they would be instructed, if you know how to fly an American pod/shuttle doesn't mean you can do so with a Russian/Chinese one WITHOUT TRAINING. - There is EXACTLY the amount of escape pods needed to evacuate the personell on a space station. Not even ONE SEAT MORE. Why should there be a reserve pod? Bringing thing up into space is expensive. - She is trained how to fly a capsule but she is not trained that if you land in water you have to get rid of your space suite before you leave your craft? That is something scientific personell actually IS instructed in. - Underwear. Sorry Sandra, you don't wear sexy underwear in space, you wear diapers and many wrappers of ugly stuff. - Hubble and ISS are on completely different orbits and by far not in the line of sight of each other (except you can see 100mi+ in the BEST case, meaning when the orbits are closest) - Bullock plays a medical doctor. What the fuck is she doing with Hubble? - ... Physics fails (which is nearly everything, but I'll give you some): - Kessler syndrome is pictured wrong. Though it is true that collisions between space debris creates bigger clouds of smaller debris which will most likely cause problems for space traveling in the future and already has partially, this is a process that takes more than a few minutes (for some satelites this will be months to years or even decades). It is very unlikely for objects in space to hit each other, even in fixed orbits, space is HUGE. The movie states this can happen within minutes. - If there would be satelites in the same orbit (height) as the ISS they would have the EXACT same speed as the ISS. If an object gains speed in the direction it is flying into it gains height, meaning it will go to a higher orbit. - You can see the debris field flying towards the ISS and it is pretty slow. The ISS has an orbital speed of 28000 km/h. A debris field on the same orbit would have the EXACT same speed as the ISS. However, if the debris field would have a different inclination AND the same orbital height and speed it CAN be possible that they cross their path after ~93 minutes (the time the ISS takes to fly around the earth once). But there are a lot of calculations needed to rendezvous with an orbital object in space, there is NO WAY a random debris field hits the same object twice. However, if there were 2 objects on same orbits with different inclination having a rendezvous the colision speed would be pretty high (and by pretty high I mean several times the speed of sound). - Communication satelites are on much, much higher orbits than the ISS (meaning 100x higher). There is NO WAY a debris field in the orbit of the ISS can ever hit a satelite that far away within such a short amount of time and take all satelites out. This is ridiculously stupid. - BTW orbits: The satelite debris flies into the wrong direction (satelites fly west to east, not east to west). - Even if this would happen, communication between Earth and the ISS doesn't rely on satelites only, so even if all satelites in space would disappear all of a sudden you would still be able to have radio contact to Earth. - The rope scene where Clooney plays the hero: My brain hurt. It seems Newtons first law doesn't apply in space. Wrong. It does. So after the rope was stretched they would've bounced back towards the ISS (not to mention the stupidity of the rest of the whole scene like when Bullock opens the outter airlock it would have smashed her to nirvana). - Why is the Chinese space station falling towards earth again? And if so, how for fucks sake could Bullock be in the reach of it? Remember orbits and speeds? - The teardrop is bullshit. Even if you haven't got the $100 to ask a physics student you could at least have watched some of Chris Hadfield's explanations on Youtube. - ... That's about the things they got wrong. On an emotional level thought, this movie... still sucks. ""... be able to watch and understand this movie deeply ..."" It's about not giving in even if you are close to losing your will to fight for your life, got that. Pretty emotional, huh? Too bad Bullock is a very bad actress for roles like that and the scenario didn't get me (I may have been influenced by the huge amount of physical and logical bullshit going on, who knows?). There are a lot of movies that get the emotional part for losing your will to live and the ""fight for your life against nature""-stuff better, e.g. The Grey, Into The Wild, 127 Hours and so on. And they are all more credible (damn, Liam Neeson fights a CGI wolf and I still find it more emotional). What was left of the movie for me was a huge CGI-orgy and personally I don't like CGI-orgies. But that's just a matter of opinion. For me, given the stupid story and the bad acting, Gravity is on the same level as Transformers just with less cool robots. Is that enough of an explanation? :D",2

Anyways, I disagree with you on your opinion of the movie, but I won't hate on you. You're entitled to your views. I think one of the reasons I love the movie is that there was so much more to it than meets the eye. I literally got goosebumps when I realized that the movie was an allegory for rebirth. When Sandra Bullock finally reached Earth at the end I felt like she escaped the darkness within herself (space). Yeah, all this might sound cheesy, but I really love deep movies. If you ever decide to watch it again, watch it with these themes in mind. It could turn out to be a whole different experience for you if you realize that the movie isn't really about space, but about rediscovering yourself. Btw, what are your thoughts on the Hobbit films? Are you a fan of the book or the movies? Personally, I feel that the movies were a bit disappointing (except for that dragon lol).",11

But seriously, I enjoyed Gravity to an extent. The action scenes were amazing and. . . well. . . that's about it. The cast was a poor choice. Watching Bullock ,(A trained astronaut.), fret for for her life like she did was just dumb. For ANYONE to be qualified to go on a spacewalk, ESPECIALLY to service the Hubble, that person would have had to go through months of training and preparation. Not only training for when it goes right, but when it goes wrong. In fact, a large portion of Astronaut training exercises focus on situations that go wrong, to prepare the astronaut for a dangerous mission. A mission, might I add, you wouldn't be chatting it up during. ""WHAT DO I DO WHAT DO I DO?!"" is a statement you should NEVER hear from an astronaut, and especially not a space-walker. And I shouldn't even mention the useless ""Oh you're running out of air"" mechanic that served no purpose. After telling her to breathe lightly, Clooney then proceeds to ask her about her life back on Earth. I call BS. I wouldn't have had a problem in a more Science-fiction movie, but this entire flick is meant to actually happen. And it can. And if they wanted to be accurate, they sure didn't do a good job. I don't feel like pointing out all of the movies flaws. But I must re-state: I did not hate this movie. I just think it was a simple ""cash-in"" on space to the general audience. The praise this movie is getting is(in my opinion) not deserved. I'm seeing this movie being put on number 1 spots on top 10 Space movies, or some other countdown. The word ""Brilliant"" is a VERY generous compliment to Gravity. Not to say that it sucked the big one, but definitely not the top of its class. If people are impressed and ""deeply moved"" by this movie, they are most likely new to the genre. Go watch 2001: A Space Odyssey. LOADS better.",1,false,0,,,,,,

""1) Bullock is nauseous during a space walk. This would never happen. It is only during space walks that space sickness can kill, because vomiting in your enclosed suit would cause you to inhale and choke on the vomit. It is for this reason that food is not consumed for hours prior to an EVA (Extra Vehicular Activity) and astronauts are required to abort the walk when there's even a hint of nausea 2) Bullock is untethered,spinning and flailing in space. This is highly unlikely. NASA procedure is to always have an emergency MMU called a SAFER during EVA. The pack is programmed to automatically adjust yaw, roll, and pitch to stop the astronaut from spinning. Routine procedure is then to manually take control of the jetpack and use it to return to the space vehicle 3) The Soyez TMA re-entry module requires an EVA to disengage the chute. Correct me if I'm wrong, but it is my understanding that this model would allow the astronaut to disengage the chute from within the capsule. BTW, if the chute did deploy, it wouldn't have been opened up and spread all over the station. The parachute compartment hatch would have simply been blown off and the parachute would have remained packed away in the module - there is no wind in space 4) The opening line states that there is no sound in space. However, we hear the wrench actuating when used by Sandra Bullock 5) George Clooney has Bullock on a long tether to distance her from the jets on his jetpack. However, he's holding on to her in front of himself, where she is just as clear of them as he is. Also, the propellent is inert gas, so it would not have hurt her. BTW, Clooney later drifts into space when there is no discernible force to push him away from Bullock 6) The re-entry capsules have a hard 60-second count down before undocking. No way. Design of space vehicles offer manual over-rides for nearly everything. If there were a count down, then there would be an over-ride as well 7) One exploding satellite would not cause a chain reaction of debris. It's called space for a reason, there is a lot of it. Debris from one satellite is highly unlikely to cause further debris 8) Every satellite and space station is bombarded by the debris as if they are all in the same orbit. They are not. For that matter, neither is the Hubble and ISS 9) When Bullock takes off her space suit, there is no liquid cooled ventilation unit, catheter, or diaper: which are required attire for EVA 10) Bullock stabilizes and orients the proper re-entry path of the re-entry module from a spin while well beyond the window for a deorbit burn 11) No way someone with the emotional baggage of Bullock's character would ever be chosen for a space mission 12) Bullock went through astronaut training and wasn't taught to brace herself when using a propellent in zero G 13) The hatch on the Soyez reentry module is much higher and would not have flooded so easily. Additionally, the Soyez, while being designed to land on solid ground, is also designed with floatation devices for water landing and does not have explosive bolts on the hatch. So it would not have flooded like Grissom's Liberty Bell 7""",0,false,0,,,,,,

When you have compressed air, it creates a force equal and opposite to the way it disperses. One could definitely use it to move around in space. That part is true physics. You a literally weightless in space. Not massless. Your mass stays the same, but you have no weight. That's the difference between lbs and kilograms.

And the action sequences weren't all that exciting either seeing as you could see them coming from a mile away and you knew she was always going to survive each disaster as by halfway through the movie, she's already came through quite a few of them unscathed so all the suspense already begins to feel cheap.

They also know many if not most trailers on youtube don't have idiots ruining it to the degree you did. Most would also just apologize after.

If you were that bright enough to begin with you would have seen the depths of the movie and not had to question the way it played out to begin with. There's a good answer for that too, but i'll save that for someone who gives an actual shit about others experiences and not just their own. If you don't care about others experiences, why in the hell would or should we answer your question? So there, there's a book for ya.

Space stations, telescopes and communication satellites do not orbit the planet on a narrow circular orbit 100 meters wide. One destroyed satellite physically cannot destroy half of man-made objects in orbit. 2. Assuming that exploded satellite was in motion, so its debris will also be in motion. After each subsequent collision they will lose momentum and kinetic energy, which means they will randomly change direction and slow down. 3. The cloud definitely possessed an advanced AI, since it was picking its targets very accurately. On several occasions it precisely destroyed the shuttle crew and ISS, but all debris all the time missed Bullock herself even when she was in outer space near the aforementioned ISS.",14

Ok, let me spell it out for you, Jason (I'll capitalize the most crucial parts so that you don't miss them). And a little piece of advice for the future - before posting quotes from wikipedia with a smart look on your face at least do SOME READING on the subject. 1. All space objects shown to form the cloud in the movie are located on different altitudes and have different orbit inclines (which I already mentioned here). Astophysicists who analyzed the movie pointed out that all those objects COULDN'T BE DESTROYED in a chain reaction (unless explosions happen on all altitudes simultaneously, which is not the case in the movie). 2. If you bothered to spend some time reading about Kessler syndrome, you would know that its depiction in the movie in UNREALISTIC and DOES NOT CORRESPOND TO REAL LAWS OF PHYSICS. The event itself is possible, but a significant density of artificial objects is required for that and it will take decades to accumulate debris, not 15 minutes. If you're looking for a realistic depiction of space works (including the theme of space debris) in near future, ""Planetes"" would be a good choice.",8

I don't wanna start an argument, i just wanna debate about this. I can very well be wrong. You're right, but assuming, for storytelling purposes, the objects were that close and had orbits with periods that allowed them to remain together during the duration of the film. Plus let's assume Russia would be dumb enough to use a missile to deorbit(?) a satellite. That's pretty dumb in itself. Also let's assume all comms sats are all snuggling together at those orbits. Hitting a satellite would make a lot of debris with a lot of small parts what would have to orbit Earth at incredibly high speeds in order to remain in that orbit. That could very well generate a cloud. Subsequent hits could make that cloud bigger and denser. I don't see how a cloud of high speed debris couldn't destroy the ISS or a shuttle.",5

But probably you're right, it might have been too much. You are correct that the concept of accumulating space debris is very real, I was just saying that it is not portrayed in the movie realistically. This is not a documentary, so of course a director had to take some liberties and use exaggerations to keep the plot going. I understand that very well. Actually, the original point of my comment was not to discuss scientific inaccuracies of the film, but to emphasize the absence of plot and character development here.

How come did they let such a clumsy and clueless astronaut into space? Why didn't they salvage extra oxygen or fuel from the shuttle/other space suits? Why didn't she use the RCS on the soyuz to get to the chinese space station? Why didn't Clooney drop the jetpack in order to push it to gain momentum towards the space station?

But when ya compare 2001 to the actual NASA footage, not even close. This is actually my counter argument to moon hoaxers, that not even Kubrick could have convincingly faked the moon landings, and he was state of the art. That's one of the many impressive things about 2001, that it doesn't look or feel dated at all, expect for a bit of the special effects. Most of the special effects hold up, except, for example, when he uses a photograph of the moon's surface to represent the moon. Pretty obvious. But most of it, the way the models are lit, the rear projection and so on, so well done, holds up. And the inside of the Jupiter doesn't look dated, the data that is scrolling on the various monitors.",0

The command module and the lander, orbiting the moon, and the lander eventually landing on the moon, not possible to fake in those days. Really wouldn't be possible today, either. CGI, while impressive, still is obviously CGI. That's the only info I've ever needed. Interesting that you mention the flags, There have been recent photos of the flags. Some are still intact. Another tarantula thrown into the hoax. And not just flags, Apollo debris, remnants, left behind. One would have to believe that the current generation of NASA would still be invested in protecting the secret, that it's an ongoing conspiracy, up to this very day, and NASA is faking photos of Apollo debris on the moon, 45 years on.

Gravity where the ISS is stationed is almost the same as if you were to stand at sea altitude. The only thing preventing the ISS from dropping down is the speed of orbit. To put the speed in perspective, it completes a full orbit in 90 minutes. Actually, I will quote the NASA website here: "" a person who weighs 100 pounds on the ground would weigh 90 pounds there [ISS]"". So if you wonder why people in the ISS float, it is because the ISS and the people inside the ISS are obriting or freefalling around the earth at the same speed. The only thing preventing the ISS from crashing down to Earth is the speed. That is also why you see geo-stationary satellites far away from Earth, to avoid getting pulled back down to earth.

Also the movie was 90 minutes (an hour and a half) and most movies don't go over two hours. About another 15 or 20 minutes added to the movie would have made it average run time.

The script is boring, lacks imagination, lacks special effects. I even had to fast forward it a times. Star Trek and Lost in Space ( the early episodes) show much more imagination as well as a far more intelligent story line. If you have an above average intelligence then you must pass this by as it is a waste of time. Sandra Bullocks face lift is however suited to s/fiction though how you can class this movie in this slot is beyond me. The music is nothing original, just a lot of noise really, def not memorable.

Well let me tell you how a normal movie-watcher would react to that: ""So wait, she went trough all that trouble and died anyway? That's lame"". And you're just complaining about something completely normal by movie standards. If you're looking for bad endings, just watch a horror movie or something. With sharks. It seems you enjoy those.

I will stress now that for those of you who didn't like this film, I have no problem with that whatsoever! We all have different tastes and film is subjective at the end of the day. There are going to be films that many people like that you don't and vice versa. We all have different perspectives when it comes to films, so I think it's wrong for people to call you idiots or whatever. For me personally, I loved Gravity. I saw it in the cinema last November and I loved it. I bought the Blu-Ray yesterday, watched it last night, I loved it. It's my favourite film of 2013. Why do I love it you may ask? Well, first and foremost, it was because of the experience of being in outer space. Gravity is very much an experience film. A film that you're supposed to immerse yourself in and go in for the ride. On that basis, Gravity delivered that aspect for me. The direction, visuals, music and even the physics portrayed in this film helped that tremendously in my opinion. Just watching the visuals and seeing Sandra Bullock's character overcome the odds stacked against her was intense and absorbing. Because I felt like I was in space with her, I felt her emotions, I felt her loneliness, I felt her need to survive. Also, the end sequence? It gives me chills every time. It is an amazing sequence with the visuals and especially the music. It's a film that's not so much to be watched as it is to be felt and it's also a survival film. What annoys me about the reaction to this film is how many people just look for the bad things in it and they totally disregard the good stuff. Do we look at all the individual moments we hate or dislike in a film, or do we look at the bigger picture? I think it makes more sense to balance out the good and the bad of a film and see which one holds up more, instead of just focusing on the bad. One of the complaints people give is that it has no story. I disagree. It is a basic story, but it's still a story! A story about a person in space trying to get back to earth after a disaster takes place. After all, it is a survival film. There's only so much you can do with a premise about a person trying to survive a disaster or an event that arises. I mean, what were people expecting with a film like this? Considering the basic material Alfonson Cuaron had to work with, I thought he did a great job! The film also deals with issues like loneliness, despair, isolation, spirituality, etc, so there's more to this film than people give credit for. I've never seen a survival film done this way before, so Cuaron covered new ground with this film in my opinion. In terms of the physics, dialogue and cliches in this film? There were maybe a couple of problems, but they never really bothered me that much. It's in my top ten favourite films of all time and I don't care if people think I'm overrating the film or that I don't have a good taste. I loved the film and nobody will change my enjoyment of this film! At the end of the day though, if people don't like it because they found it boring or they couldn't get into it, that's totally fine. We all have different opinions and it's a shame that a fair amount of people don't like it, but I wish people wouldn't be as harsh on this film and at least consider the good aspects to it and I believe you can find many. Some people who call it the worst film ever made are just being WAY too critical in my opinion. If you think I have a bad taste in films, here are my top ten favourite films of all time so you can be the judge: 10. Groundhog Day 9. Inception 8. It’s a Wonderful Life 7. Brazil 6. Gravity 5. The Lord of the Rings Trilogy 4. The Elephant Man 3. Fantasia 2. Vertigo 1. 2001: A Space Odyssey I wanted to post this message because I feel that, while people are not wrong for disliking this film, I do believe some people are being a bit too harsh on it in my humble opinion. I mean, why do some people feel the need to be so aggressively negative towards to it? It's just a film at the end of the day. Don't get so worked up over it! and secondly, I wanted to let some of you guys know why me and many others loved this film.",1,false,0,,,,,,

I'll try it, view it again. Not to mention Clooney, joyriding around the shuttle, and somehow after the shit hits the fan, he has enough fuel left to retrieve Bullock. Those packs have, what, a range of a kilometer. And Bullock, out of oxygen, somehow makes it to the rooskie space station, and, of course, has her dramatic moment where Clooney encourages her to press on, you can make it, all the while sucking in carbon dioxide.

The drive to ever give up on some event no matter what the situation is and the drive to improve your own personal life through it. The two astronauts characters are simply astronauts. They have their own definitions and how they view space based of past and current experiences.

When ya make a flick in space, that pesky physics gets in the way. Just ask George Lucas. I don't find the characters interesting, simple as that. Watching True Detective at the moment. The writing and character development is infinitely more interesting. In a flick like Star Wars, like most space flicks, they make up their own space physics. In a flick like Star Wars, who cares, Doesn't matter. But Gravity presumes to get it right. Right at the beginning, they lay out the actual conditions in space. The assumption is, this ain't Star Wars folks, we're gonna try to get this right this time. Then they proceed to ignore their premise. Kubrick was the first guy before or since who has tried to get it right. He was meticulous. In fact, they were ticked at themselves, Kubes and Clark, after it came out when they realized that Bowman should not have held his breath when he reentered the Jupiter craft. BTW, almost no scored music. Kubrick exploited the silence that space provides. Love to see somebody hire a Neil Degrasse Tyson as a cowriter, and write a realistic portrayal of conditions in space. That I would get off to. I don't need a tear jerker moment between 2 characters that is total BS from a physics point of view. I just don't find that interesting in the least. Show me what it's really like. Louis CK made this point. Whomever made Gravity had an opportunity to teach people a thing or 2 about physics. They blew it.",0

Pizzolatto knows how to write amusing dialogue, develop characters. Vince Gilligan, another sensational writer, knows how to write interesting, amusing dialogue, develop characters, if he and Tyson got together, wrote a space flick, potential dynamite combo. The Coen brothers and Tyson, potentially a blast of a flick. Don't think the Coens have ever expressed any interest in doing a space flick, but love to see it. Don't think the Coens would have any interest in making a space flick and ignoring the physics of space in the process. Think they would be as meticulous as Kubes. The basic idea, the chain reaction thing, nifty idea. If they had taken that idea, and started with, ok, everybody dies, agreed? If they had started there, it's already a more interesting flick. Nobody survives anything this catastrophic, except in a Hollywood movie, starring Sandra Bullock. But if they kill off everybody, including Bullock, they probably don't get the financing, it never gets made, and it never rakes in a gazillion bucks.",0

I enjoy movies that either have a thought provoking and logical plot which leaves people meditating and imagining, or adrenaline pumping action that lift our spirit for life. Unfortunately, Gravity sorely lacks both. Some might say it is intense, and adrenaline pumping. I am afraid that I feel the whole movie looks ordinary, if not completely dull to me, and the emotions felt corny in a way. Normally I'd say in 10yrs the sci-fi we see today will look like a joke (in terms of computer stunts), but already today I felt Gravity stunts look like a joke to me.",0

I liked the visual effects and give credit to the struggles of how just one person can pull against the odds for survival as long as she's determined. Human beings have the determination to survive. I think it focused on the emotions of what someone could go through as far as anxiety, hopelessness, despair, and determination to pull through, b focused, and be faithful in her religious right despite people's whiney fuss over their own religious views who'll respond to that alone. However, I'm already sick of this new Hollywood trend where they're leaving the endings up to the viewers imagination. This movie reminded me so much of Life of Pi. Beautiful capture of nature and a similar strugle. Ones with space and a debris field; the others with a Bengal tiger and a storm at sea. Either way, I see the struggle, but I hate these new aged films. Nevertheless, they're at least trying to do something different opposed to the same ole shoot em action movies that's grown boring.

As the cords absorb her kinetic energy, they stretch.

z13lxfbx0ri5wr3dd22szndrso3kfxnpm04,Alex Barbu,2 years ago (edited),1412397524015,"Spoilers Gravity, aka Hollywood's way of saying that I know more about the hazard of space, than a so called ""trained astronaut"". I practically predicted everything that these guys did horrifically wrong: 1) Matt (George Clooney) would have lived, if he weren't a cocky son of a bitch, that wanted to break that stupid ""longest space walk"" record, and if he didn't waste his fuel by flying laps around the space shuttle. 2) When you hear that space debris is coming your way, you drop everything IMMEDIATELY! 3) NASA could have predicted that there might be a debris chain reaction and would have called the mission off earlier. (also someone pointed out, that such a chain reaction is actually impossible) 4) I don't buy for a second that NASA couldn't establish ANY communication with the astronauts for the rest of the movie. A fucking Chinese bloke with a radio on Earth managed to contact Ryan (Sandra Bullock) in the Soyuz pod. 5) Ryan couldn't detach a harness that is made to be easy to handle. She stayed there like 2 minutes before detaching. 6) Any astronaut knows that oxygen is in short supply in space, and won't fucking have a panic attack every 5 minutes. An astronaut is trained to control their breathing. 7) Continuing the oxygen issue, you don't talk non-stop in space. Talking uses up more air. Matt knew Ryan had her tank low, yet he insisted she talked back to him. 8) These damn astronauts can't grab hold of anything if their life depended on it. Literally. Also those damn tethers break too easily. 9) There is a possibility that Matt could have lived if they both pulled fast and hard on that stupid tether. He would have definitely lived if he wasn't a cocky bastard earlier (see 1.) 10) Ryan takes a nice space stroll through the ISS (knowing full well that she is in danger). While doing this she didn't notice (or pay attention to) the electrical fire that was just starting. Also the fire alarm didn't detect fire, it only detected a fucking inferno. Fire is the most dangerous thing in space because oxygen saturation is a lot higher. Also without gravity, it's harder to control and it spreads faster. The fire detectors should detect a light candle, not wait till an out of control fire. 11) Ryan spend too much time on the intercom, trying to reach Matt or NASA, when it was already establish that Houston hasn't paid their phone bill. 12) Ryan doesn't know to brace herself before attempting to use a fire extinguisher in space. (At least she learned the hard way, and will use it properly later on). 13) NASA couldn't patch the software of the Soyuz to be able to use other languages (besides Russian) if necessary. It's the International Space Station. The only escape pods available should use a more international language. (i.e. English) 14) Ryan isn't careful enough with her tools. She almost lost that screwdriver while detaching the parachute off the Soyuz. 15) Ryan might be mentally challenged. She started howling like a wolf, to a Chinese bloke, instead of trying to save her ass. Also she is clearly depressed with suicidal tendencies. She probably wouldn't have gotten an OK from NASA. (Also hallucinating. But that could be because of the lack of oxygen). 16) Earlier Ryan proved she could stabilize the Soyuz pod, but when the Chinese Shenzou spirals out of control she does nothing. Autopilots are good, but that pod probably would have burned on re-entry in real life. 17) Ryan didn't try to respond to NASA before exiting the pod. Also she should have taken the uniform off before exiting the pod. Or she could have tried keeping her helmet on. No smoke to get in her suit, she could have just waited there for the rescue. (unless the pod caught fire. In that case she would have bailed out). So Hollywood, congrats on disappointing yet again.",0,true,2,,,,,,

I'm not the one making big budget movies, with big name actors. Hollywood is. And Hollywood is screwing things up a lot lately. Maybe I did nitpick, but this was supposed to be a realistic situation. If the movie was about some astronauts colonizing Mars or Pandora or something, I would have probably let it slide. Just as I don't nitpick on Iron Man, because it isn't supposed to be realistic. Gravity, on the other hand, was supposed to portray realistically, what could happen to astronauts lost in space. The story is set in our time, in our universe. Not in the future, nor in some other imagined universe (Iron Man, Avengers, etc).",0

Someone like Dr. Stone, who has so much emotional baggage, wouldn't be allowed on a flight to the ISS. For an average citizen who doesn't know what the requirements are to be an astronaut, Dr. Stone might seem like a possible candidate, but in reality this wouldn't happen. I was actually hooked to this movie the first few minutes, I'm a fan of astrophysics and I work in a hospital lab, like Dr. Stone. I tried to enjoy the movie. When they showed George messing around with his jet pack at the start, I thought to myself, ""huh, I guess they have a huge supply of jet fuel for the pack"". Then it turns out George dies because he runs out of fuel. Not to mention the fact that ""leap frogging"" from one space station to the next is absolutely ridiculous.

I think she was working with NASA (or what have you) before her daughter died. To be sent into space you have to be trained for years. So I think she is some sort of trained technician sent up to the Explorer to do some maintenance. Despite being terrified of being in space for the first time, she seemed fairly experienced with the hardware. Well, George was messing around since it was suppose to just be a quick space walk, but then he had to go after Stone and bring her to the station; I'm assuming hours have passed, so I don't think that is out of the question either.

As I said, she is not Astronaut as Clooney's character, and NASA did not expect this tragedy happen, and if not I guess Dr. Stone can implement her stuff successfully, and they all fly back to earth safely with no any issues. And if Sandra get rid off her panic at the beginning, so basically, we just sit there and watch her survive her own way which makes movie become duller than this. IMHO, her panic creates the tension of this movie, regardless of you don't like her gone berserk or not. I know Gravity is not perfect movie, but on technical and visual sides this movie take the next step of creating movie industry.

They are not, they are simulations of a undesired reality. But there is so much more wrong with the movie, like the part she is actually talking like a dog to a dog? There is no attachment at all for the viewer with her in the lonely situation she is in as a astronaut. Look the effects are great no doubt about that. The performance of Sandra is almost like she is doing Speed 3 on way to many moments. It is like she has not grown as an actor at all. And Clooney is more a set piece then anything els. The effects are like I said good, but they are no more then golden paint on a turd, and that turd still smells funny golden paint or not. This reviewer on IMDB says it good; Effective drama requires an intellectual investment in the credibility of the story, the characters and the interaction between them.

I find the movie to be somewhat silly and hokey, and not entirely believable, but believable enough to have an effect. I empathized with the characters and felt an understanding of their emotions and their character growth. Suspension of disbelief. Just as we look at any form of creative expression and art and connect with it as it exaggerates and accentuates reality, this is an artistic, entertainment movie where we don't need to believe everything on screen. I personally feel humble enough to enjoy this movie wholeheartedly because I feel I understand the creative licenses the director/writer had taken to express a point of view. Also, to suggest that ""there is no attachment at all for the viewer"" — when I find and millions of others find themselves attaching to the characters — shows flaws in the expression of your statements. This is your opinion and you need to express yourself as it is your opinion, not as statements of fact. That way, you will be less likely to be combative with others as a result.

I think the cinematography is good, good... just that, I think the one who should have won that globe was the cinematographer and not Cuaron... they said this movie was better than kubriks master piece... well as a cinematographer myself I say gravity sucks and I am mexican and well, ofcourse its better than that other movie of Dervez... but I don`t think this gravity movie can outcome the kubriks movie... Of course its a good movie, but no... no its not a super movie not even better than kubrik movie... man and the VFX are splendid... but hey, the end? when we step out of the theater... we were like wtf with the end? I mean Children of the men, was waaaaay better than this movie... and still I think it diservs good things... but hey, Guillermo del Toro he should won a Oscar, like Crhistopher Doyle said when Life of Pi won an oscar... for the best photo... he said thats not a good cinematographer thats a good VFX!!! so this movie also is VFX... and no its not better than other movies, there are better space movies and this GRAVITY movie aint that good...",3

This movie was very good but I just can't call it perfect. The only thing that bothered me (during the movie..keep reading) is that it's not very realistic, she's a medical engineer repairing a Hubble space telescope, flying a spaceship out of manuals, flying a Chinese spaceship without knowing a word of Mandarin, surviving fires and explosions in a spacecraft, and all that for a rookie? Not very believable but not impossible of course. But I also figured out that this movie was supposed to be like that, because it is about surviving against all odds, it is about our instinct to survive even when everything else fails. Because of the fact that I expected I sci-fi movie and I get a sci movie, I got disappointed. It's my fault, I expected some more ""fi"".. Things I particulary liked is that I think it perfectly captured that feeling in space regarding everything, it was amazing. But, like I said, it's some kind of surviving genre, a nature and tech genre, and I didn't get that only after movie finished and me writing this comment here. Of course, the movie has other meanings as well, like Robin said it's symbolic and it can mean different things for different people.

z12nzh2o0tjuuppzc04cjrgxhxjlf525zi0,teppolundgren,2 years ago (edited),1412397553069,"Compared with what usually passes for ""good"" cinema these days, let alone Sci-fi, this film is pretty damn good. Having said that, it's also quite a strange mix of cliches, action spectacle, introspective drama and thriller elements. The action is indeed spectacular. And I think if Kubrick could've seen just how impressive the exterior space scenes look in this film, he might not have bothered with 2001: A Space Odyssey. He might have given up! The thriller elements are also very successful, in the way that there is really no antagonist in the film. Well, not unless you count space itself, of course. And there's a lot of excitement to be had with those damn oxygen tanks that always want to deplete at the worst possible moments. In fact, I think ""Oxygen"" might have been a better title for the film. Especially since the story has very little to do with gravity, and the crew's survival is utterly dependent on that precious O2. The dramatic part is where I thought the film felt a bit underwhelming. And this is in large part due to, what I consider, the miscasting of Sandra Bullock in the lead. No no, she's not bad in the part. But showing emotion is not her greatest strength, and emotion is ultimately what's supposed to drive this entire film. We, as the audience, are supposed to root for her. We're supposed to feel her frustration and anger, and empathize with her sense of hopelessness. And we're meant to share her progress and setbacks. In other words, we should be with her on her journey to safety and some sort of personal redemption. Unfortunately, that didn't happen for me. I found Sandra Bullock to be a little too stiff, and as a result, I didn't really relate enough to her to be fully engaged with the outcome. The way I see it, it could have been almost ANYONE in that space suit, since I had so little emotional investment with the character. No matter who would be trying to survive this ordeal, it would of course be exciting to watch, but without the emotional involvement, it doesn't feel like a great loss if the worst happens, and therefor, the film has (sort of) failed as a drama. I also didn't like the blatantly obvious religious overtones in the film. There are references everywhere. Even when we're in the Chinese space station, we're ""treated"" to a huge closeup of a Buddha statuette. Not to mention the return of ""Angel George"" at one crucial point. Or how Sandra, who's playing a doctor (a scientist), after admitting that she doesn't know how to pray because she never needed to, suddenly has a change of heart in the face of danger, and now ""talks to God"". I don't know, perhaps it's the Atheist in me that finds this hard to deal with. And the worst line of the film is: ""Half of North America just lost their Facebook"". SO? Facebook sucks! The loss of it would be good news! All in all, though, the film does avoid the worst of the usual space cliches. And when it doesn't, at least it weaves them into the story in a credible way, so that they don't distract us from what's important, unlike so many other films of this genre. And even though I've been bitching a bit about it, Gravity is by far the best Sci-fi film I've seen since Danny Boyle's Sunshine. Actually, Gravity is a much better film, and unlike Sunshine, it doesn't fuck up the ending. Worth watching, people!",0,true,2,,,,,,

What message would that be? Not that she landed on earth, not that she appreciated the dirty sand on the beach, I'm talking about the fact that the movie ended where it did, what message? And to those who say it said that a rescue team was deployer, I'm sorry, I must have missed that then. If that's the case the ending isn't as bad as I first thought, but I'd still appreciate an ending with more closure. They keep talking about ""the incredible story"" she gets to tell if she makes it back, but we NEVER get to see her tell that story. But each to his own, there is no blueprint for what is right and wrong here, I just stated my opinion, and my opinion is that I don't like ""open endings"" like this, it's the the entire movie builds up to the point where she is reunited with her child and society, and you never get to see it, it's a huge disappointment for me. I love endings like Inception that makes you think, that's fine, because it's an actual open ending that's puzzling and intelligent at the same time, endings like this is just a lazy attempt at making the movie artistic imo. Gravity is like Cast Away with an even worse ending, to me the movie builds up towards something you never get to see, it leaves me with an immense feeling of dissatisfaction. Again, my opinion, no need to get upset or label it as ""wrong"" just because your opinion differs from it (that goes to all the other comments here). This ending just doesn't leave me thinking as it seems like it's intended to do, it just leaves me dissatisfied, by not giving me what I've been looking forward to the entire movie.",1

The same satellite communications that didn't work when she was in space, won't work while she is on the ground. Then add the fact that the visible land marks placed her over Egypt when she re entered the atmosphere. This would have almost guaranteed that if she managed to come down on land, which according to the movie she did, she would have landed in China or South East Asia. The United States sending a rescue team into China, Laos or Vietnam without a lot of hesitation is very unlikely. The fact that she came down over land at all is very unlikely given her position.

z13peh5oiv3bjxwio04cdrtwkybifdrg5dg,Goreuncle,2 years ago (edited),1412397558891,"Before I say anything else, I want to make it clear that Gravity is pretty unique, this is a singular and interesting movie Don't worry, I'm not going to make spoilers. I'll just point out some aspects that are explained at the very beginning of the movie and some other that doesn't have much importance in the plot, so don't worry, you can keep reading safely. That said, I don't appreciate AT ALL how Russians are portrayed, they seem stupid and incompetent in the movie. The idea of Russians disposing of satellites with missiles without having things under control is just absurd. I'm sick and tired of the obsolete Cold War drill of always blaming Russians for virtually anything, as if they were dumb, evil or something. Russia has been one of the most competent, prepared, talented and successful countries regarding space exploration. Hell, they were the first to launch a satellite, a dog and a man to outer space. They have been admirable pioneers of space travel since 1957. Now even American astronauts use the Russian Soyuz to get to the ISS, and they also learn Russian. If Russians were such fools, why the hell would Americans do this? It's easy, because Russians aren't fools, in fact they are pretty good at what they do. A couple of other things: 1- When you grab a moving object (like a ship) in outer space, you end up moving exactly at the same speed, direction, rotation, etc. as the object itself. It doesn't matter if you let go of it. As long as there's no pushing, pulling or acceleration, your movement and velocity will be exactly the same as that object's, you won't move away from it. If your ship is orbiting in space and you just let go of it, you'll keep your position relative to it for as long as neither of you accelerates. There's no moving away stuff, once you ""get caught"" by an object, you move exactly like it and your position relative to it is conserved. Pay atention to one particular scene with Clooney and you'll understand why I say this. 2- Astronauts in the movie move too fast through space in relation to the rest of moving objects. It almost seems like they are actually on Earth's atmosphere sometimes, judging by the speed of their movement relative to the other things. In space there's no such thing as moving fast in relation to your ship when it's already orbiting and you just let go of it or push/pull yourself a bit...not unless one of you starts accelerating a lot. Maybe the ship can do this by burning its engines, but astronauts definitely can't get much acceleration using just their own muscles. 3-If you have an rcs system then you don't need to use the main engine in order to make the ship move. The ""Reaction Control System"" allows ships to maneuver in space, you can easily recognize it by its typical small thrusters that release white fumes every time they are activated. They don't provide much thrust, but they can make the ship move in pretty much any direction at low speeds. 4-If you don't know Chinese and you have no experience with the ship... Well, you'll understand when you see the movie. I was going to say more, but I don't want to make spoilers, so I'll end here. Gravity is like a modern version of Apollo 13 with more special effects, more dramatization and much less realism.",8,true,4,,,,,,

This movie puts you in the seat of the main character, all the sound and audio throughout the movie is coming from her point of view, knowing that makes you feel like you are experiencing precisely what she is experiencing.. AND the Special-effects that you obviously don't like, aren't made to be all up in your face like transformers or other movies.. it's made to be realistic, if you don't think about the fact that they are special effects in this movie, believe me you won't notice it.. the effects are that good.

I would recommend that you make sure you see it in 3D at the Cinema (this coming from someone who hates 3D) as the 3-D in this film really does work and doesnt just have a 2D background with one part of the screen popping out at you. It immerses you fully into the film. Sure ive heard there are a few technical facts that are wrong and Cuaron admitted he knew about these but it was necessary for the sake of the medium of making a film. This isnt a NASA information video. The film is not on the same level in terms of 2001 Space Odyssey in terms of depth, its a far more visceral film that needs to be experienced in the cinema. Id also say the first half of the film is excellent and the second half is solid but not as good. There are still some metaphorical elements to the film revolving around sandra bullocks character and her reason for living or wanting to survive (I wont say any more as I will reveal spoilers.)

When the Chinese station falls, its flapping solar panel shows a gradual increase of air particles hitting it, damn right Gravity. 4) Hull ionization during re-entry due to high contact temperature, Sandra's escape pod's radio blacked out during re-entry showed this, Gravity ain't playing. he aint. 5) Conservation of Momentum, Sandra kept spinning in the beginning, in other sci-fi Sandra would probably slow down, which disobeys the law.

As the cords absorb her kinetic energy, they stretch. Kowalski's interpretation of the situation is that the cords are not strong enough to absorb his kinetic energy as well as hers, and that he must therefore release the tether in order to give her a chance of stopping before the cords fail and doom both of them.""

""Aw, it would have been impossible to go from the sat to the ISS, lol"" seriously if that is a big issue for people then good luck with Prometheus (which makes no sense even given its own rules of logic). You cannot say that their relative speed to the ISS is zero, they could still have been drifting slightly and it not have been apparent. Clooney's speed is zero relative to Stone, but perhaps they were both still drifting. Even if that is not exactly how it APPEARS on screen (even if the result of an error), it is still EASILY forgivable, other than by anally retentive science nerds. Scientists do not write good sci-fi, and I've read a fair bit of it (yes there are probably a few exceptions).",0

It is a very high energy film and to confuse it all with a complicated storyline that it did not need only makes the viewer muddled up.

So yeah, I concur with you, the way the character is developed is almost soap-operesque, but the technical aspects of the movie make it completely worth it of the time and money I spent.",0,false,0,,,,,,
