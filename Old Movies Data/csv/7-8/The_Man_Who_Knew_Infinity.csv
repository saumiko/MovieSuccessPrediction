Ramanujan initially developed his own mathematical research in isolation; it was quickly recognized by Indian mathematicians.

This is the fundamental problem with religion because if this higher power doesn't exist then you can't really prove that it doesn't exist and it will open gate for people who can made up stuff all the time and convince society to w/e idea they want. Religion is only a tool which revolves around notion that you can control people with an idea that can't be disproved. Even when we know for a fact that those biblical stories about flood and so on are false and even when we know that church lied or was killing people for going against bible and was destroying knowledge because it didn't fit their holy book. Even when know those things for a fact... people still believe because they were indoctrinated from early childhood and scared into believing that you will go to hell if you don;t believe.

Humans are not born skeptics and are malleable individuals. We didn't learn to doubt until contradictions appear to us. Science is built around solid evidence which means that scientists are by profession, inclined to be skeptical and it shows when they come upon competing theories. But when the goal is to find the objective truth, the very foundation of a scientific experiment is to eliminate all elements that would result in an inconclusive answer. The process of math focuses on patterns of discovery based upon a numerical system. The different formulas generated by mathematicians are likewise checked and proven by other mathematicians. But since the source of these formulas are born from the human mind, it tends to have no real explanation for many other than divine inspiration. Maybe it is the way they are formed or what was done to reach the conclusion, but the subject of math is a lot like art. You have to pursue the pattern in order to reach an answer. And when you keep pursuing patterns, eventually you start seeing patterns in everything. And odds are, you might have just hit the jackpot on it.",1

People were literally killing other people and even whole nations in the name of this hypothetical god...

Of course there are plenty of groups that would succumb to zealotry, but there are more in those groups that practice more pious beliefs. Simply arguing for the worse is not an answer when you ignore the best of them. The question isn't ""why are you attacking them"", but rather ""why are you using the worse to describe them all?""

Where there are people who have thrown in with the extremes of their beliefs, you have taken refuge in the opposite position where you blame their ideology instead of seeing it for what it really is, the failures of humanity. You generally are unable to see the benefits or even the reason for the need for a belief and just continue to point fingers while hiding it behind the veneer of ""reason"". That to me, is just as bad of as falling in with the religious extremists.

They usually made very little money which often was less the poverty line. The stereotypical upper class family of 1912, they own a 'large suburban house', the father of the family is a wealthy businessman and they all have high social status. UK has been very class society (upper class, under class, above class‚Ä¶..you never know) Cambridge was a kind of club for upper class society. Mr Ramanujan (R.I.P) was outsider, he was not belonging anywhere. Mr Ramanujan was a genius, very intelligent, unusual talented person; great natural ability, but still very lonely.

Very few human being could achieve that. Ramanujan was blessed with such capacity. ''The work of that one year, while he was dying, was the equivalent of a lifetime of work for a very great mathematician,'' said Richard Askey of the University of Wisconsin. To be frank, Ramanujan surpassed euler or gauss in terms of mathematical genius which the british hates to agree. He had such an insight which great mathematician can only dream off. Ref - look at Ramanujan's formula and compare it to gauss or euler. You will probably lighten yourself up. It is british who spread rumours that he is one such among other mathematician as he was from a colonized land, India. USA recognised and given him the credit. Back to point - one can write such formulas when the person was guided by supernatural power(what he termed as ""God speaks to me"") in meditation. If you say that ""God speaks to me"" is a danger sign to any spiritual people(people who meditate upon God) in India, then Indians will laugh at you.

That is - unless one defines himself or others by their ideals, then - he is offended , and usually offended secretly. Because oddly enough - this person is the same person quickest to resort to dismissive name-calling, such as: ' fool ' or ' ignorant ' , when others cannot accept or agree with their beliefs or ideologies. And oddly enough, he is always the one, the ' open-minded ' one, who adamantly protests for - not only himself, but others not to listen to any type of scholarly scientific/philosophical truth inherently for the sake of his own personal, 'moral beliefs'. :) The so-called paradox of freedom, is the argument that freedom in the sense of absence of any constraining control must lead to very great restraint, since it makes the bully free to enslave the meek. The idea is, in a slightly different form, and with very different tendency, clearly expressed in Plato. ( I am of Greek descent - thus, I have been raised on the Philosophical teachings of our ancient forefathers, and not theological dogma ) ; but - it seems that every fool wants to tell every other fool the right way to live. It's a perpetual epidemic called universal human stupidity, which of course begets INTOLERANCE of other people's ideas or beliefs . You may live in a part of the world where you are NOT free to THINK for yourself nor declare that you DO NOT believe in any deity - however, the world does not begin nor end with India and its polytheistic practices + beliefs.

But just because there are newer ways of doing things like reading books digitally doesnt mean books are so oudated that they are no longer useful... Imagine what happens to your Kindle or whatever electronic book when an emp blast fries your circuits...the paper books didnt notice a thing. My only point is that the outdated pieces of human evolution have some usefulness still to certain people or situations. Its quite closed minded to think the newest is necessarily the best and thus the only practical choice,0

However as you said it's more likely he will be picked for the roles he has done in the past, the same with most actors. Actors are often defined by and therefore picked for roles they fit in the eye of the viewer. Want to portray an Indian mathematician, you pick the best/ most famous Indian Actor who seems to fit the role. Similarly if your casting for a kung fu master, your unlikely to pick a redneck from Texas, because the viewer is going to struggle to be convinced by him. I mean sure if you give him some elaborate backstory to explain it it can be done, but there are enough actors out there which fit particular roles to just find the perfect actor for the role.

Be it any race, I will show my disappointment regardless of ANY stereotypical role given to people of colour. It just so happens in this case I was pointing out the fact that he had to play a mainland Indian. As for Airbender he was given a role for the wrong race. The character he played should have been of east asian descent. It just seemed odd and out of place. Same goes for white people playing roles of colour e.g that abomination of a movie Gods of Egypt.

As you said, in the Last Airbender, his character should have been asian, as it would make far more sense given the theme of the world.

You wouldn't expect Jeremy Irons to be cast for a quintessentially Indian role would you, it would be ridiculous.

Though he had almost no formal training in pure mathematics, he made extraordinary contributions to mathematical analysis, number theory, infinite series, and continued fractions. Ramanujan initially developed his own mathematical research in isolation; it was quickly recognized by Indian mathematicians. When his skills became apparent to the wider mathematical community, centred in Europe at the time, he began a famous partnership with the English mathematician G. H. Hardy. He rediscovered previously known theorems in addition to producing new theorems. During his short life, Ramanujan independently compiled nearly 3,900 results (mostly identities and equations). Nearly all his claims have now been proven correct, although some were already known. He stated results that were both original and highly unconventional, such as the Ramanujan prime and the Ramanujan theta function, and these have inspired a vast amount of further research. The Ramanujan Journal, an international publication, was launched to publish work in all areas of mathematics influenced by his work. source:wiki",0,true,5,,,,,,

And by the looks of it, you have no knowledge of Indian history. The Mughals never stood a chance against the Indian Kings' armies. they could only invade a part of the North and soon they destroyed their own empire as the thrones were passed on to future kings with no skill and only rage and hatred for the Indians. Two Thirds of the country still belonged to Indian kings who's fortification was hard as rock and they never let any foreigner invade their lands. As for the British, they held more power and recognition in the outside world than the Indian kings did and had much more modernized warfare weaponry than Indian Kings. They won one single war that gave them the green card into our country. Battle of Plasey. I don't know how it's spelt. Then they entered the country and made Kolkata, one of our major cities, their capital, and slowly began spreading everywhere. They called their government our government and just out of the blue claimed our lands by their laws and took everything away from us. Some of the Indian kings wanted their alliance and power and started paying Britishers and started fighting for them against our own Indian aies who revolted against the British Empire. MILLIONS were killed by the Britishers and by their infamous strategy of 'divide' and conquer. And in those 100 years of their rule, they took our wealth that was worth over several gazillion bucks. Including the famous 'Kohinoor Diamond' that now the British Monarch proudly wears on their crown. The biggest diamond in the world. India was known as the 'Golden Bird' since it was the richest and most prosperous country of all countries, in its time. And after a hundred years of their rules and draining ALL OF WEALTH AND RESOURCES now they proudly bask in the riches of our sweat and blood while my countrymen are still recovering from its aftermath. Don't state your opinions on matters you are unaware of and don't scratch the wounds of people who have suffered a great loss. Even today, we cannot do anything about the grave injustice that was done to us. Because they have all our wealth. They are still one of the most powerful. And clearly, the world know how ungrateful they have been to us. Whatever they are, Whatever they have, is ours and of the several other countries they colonized. Also, if they would have never invaded, there would have been no division between India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Myanmar and Sri Lanka. India wasn't only the richest but also one of the biggest countries in its time. That's what really happened.",12

Thus they are more economically advantaged than most third world, non-white nations. It's simple. I mean an idiot could tell you that. You have a larger economy, and a larger affluent elite established in those lands. Stop making pointless arguements you can't win. The way a colonial power treats its subjects effects the future of that subject once independence is gained. That's why the white-majority colonies fair better. They were given very different treatment. The countries you listed are thus irrelevant. A better arguement would have been Nigeria, most of the British Caribbean (Jamaica, Trinidad, Barbados, etc.) and Zimbabwe or even Sri Lanka, Pakistan or other parts of South Asia plundered by the British. Whether it was 'neccessary' or 'the nature of humanity' is irrelevant. As a human being who isn't a complete serial killer or sociopath (hopefully) there's no reason for you to try to justify colonialism in any of its forms. Or try to defend it. The fact is the British did a disservice. THIS IS A WELL KNOWN FACT. and has been preached, printed and proven in publications for over half a century by people, conservative or liberal. The British Empire has so much blood on its hands that it's a running joke. They were just greedy a-holes, nothing more. No intellectual or true historical arguement could be made. They function the same as the Romans, or Mongols, or Ottoman Empire, or French empire, or any other major power in human history. They were monsters. For all the 'civilization' and 'laws' they introduced they also brought rape, genocide, inequality, British-style classism, prejudice, propaganda, theft, socioeconomic and geographic pillaging, stealing of land, murder, and much worse with them. It doesn't matter that invading powers in the past did the same thing, the British had the fire and manpower to do it on a larger scale--thus it was much worse, obviously. That's the point.",3

Simple as that. A lot of Europeans struggled cause they were invaded by a stronger force, and some were practically slaves cause of what has happened, so why did we manage to succeed? And not others, you can look at Singapore, Hong Kong, Australia. and not all European countries gained great amounts of resources from other countries just to become rich, far from it!

Let me retribute this again, if India has had the same or very similar culture as now as back in the days it means it'll stay a shit-hole. Hey, Norway was a pretty strong country at some point, but cus of some shit it became poor and was taken over, but then it became rich again. It's not the resources, or what happened in the past, but rather it is India or countries like India that is at fault for not being able to implement and enforce better laws and social reconstruction in a more effective way. You can be all bitter about the past, but it will not solve anyone's issues, if you cannot learn from the past and do the correct decisions then you will not be able to progress fast enough or simply fail.",0

In mathematics, ""infinity"" is often treated as if it were a number (i.e., it counts or measures things: ""an infinite number of terms"") but it is not the same sort of number as natural or real numbers. Georg Cantor formalized many ideas related to infinity and infinite sets during the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

I saw a couple recently that were extremely good. Indian directors are more than creative enough. The best are extremely good and can compete with anyone from west and east. British directors dont have any special gift that others cannot have. They have also made lots of below average films .Actually, I cant think of that many really good ones. Just because a British person make a movie based on the life of an Indian, who many will not know or could not care less for, makes them superior film directors? I dont think so. The wants of the cinema goer in India is different. This kind of film would not appeal to the masses who crave for escapism. Indian directors know their audience. The best have not become extremely rich by guessing alone. TBH, not many will really be interested in the person whose life the movie is based. They will hype it up, and people will watch it.",0

Ramanujan was a true genius and used that genius to make amazing discoveries for which there are still conferences on trying to figure out the almost magical insight of this man. He was self-educated by reading primarily a single book...which was a uniquely condensed yet comprehensive text of mathematical proofs Carr's A Synopsis of Elementary Results in Pure and Applied Mathematics. The text is available now on amazon, but was also able to be downloaded for free from the Internet Archive and google books a few years ago. Its a fascinating read which because it doesn't have the fluff that most modern publishers use for dubious reasons of adding unecessary heft for profit, would not bore a budding genius and allow him to reach a new potential quickly. His story really speaks to the fact that there are great people from humble backgrounds who can achieve miraculous things if they have the right education and support. I wonder how many Ramanjan's there are out there thoughout the world who have never had the opportunity to reach their potential.",5,true,7,,,,,,

Anyone who goes to a wikipedia page can find his accomplishments. They used to have a yearly conference in Chicago discussing trying to proof his many mathematical statements (often without proof). I don't know if you've studied maths to know but it sound like you have not. His formula are really out of this world using continued frations, strange exponentials...and they work, even though they are nothing like we normally use. His work has important applications in number theory which applies to crytography, and many of his formulas no doubt will only have application in the far future when we have the other sciences catch up with them. I fear you question either comes from ignorance of maths or perhaps racism since he was from Southern India which are given lower castes. When I was in India, it seemed there was a lot of racism toward the Soutern and darker skinned castes, which is a real shame since Ramanujan should be considered a national hero. He certainly has done a lot more for this world than most Brahmins or cricket players.",0

Whole treatises are written about a a few of his formulats. He was very unconventional and mathematicians of the day and perhaps some now might think because he did not use classical proofs that it couldn't be important...but time has shown this is not the case. He made significant inroads into continued fractional representations and also divergent series, but that was only part of this work. The whole proof thing while important was somewhat blindsided by Godel work anyways, and there are whole schools of mathematical thought (intuitionist) which have some standing. As I said, the other sciences probably have a long way to go to catch up with this stuff and use it to its full potential....even with quantum physics and quantum field theory we're working with complex numbers and integral/differential geometry developed hundred years before Ramanujan.

What a pitiable effort or lack thereof at casting. Find the one 'Indian' guy you know and put him in everything India. The only consolation is that he is at least ethnically Indian, would have been even more shameful if a white actor was cast with brownface makeup. The sad thing is that Dev Patel is Gujarati and niether looks or talks like a South Indian Brahmin like Ramanujan. It's like casting a Vietnamese guy to play Mao bc 'they all look alike'! When will hollywood bother to know that India is diverse and not everyone is Punjabi or Gujarati! When will they care to do the research to potray a Tamil guy to play Ramanujan.",2,false,0,,,,,,

A professor at Oxford received a letter, read a little of it, and then threw it in his waste basket, for he was used to getting letters from ""crackpots"" claiming to have solved this, or that... But he had a feeling.. so he took the letter out of the waste basket... and soon realized that it was written by a kid in a village in India, who had stumbled upon a math textbook, taught himself from it, and then.. invented the rest... but what he invented was stuff already discovered by great western minds such as Gauss and Euler and others.. not knowing of what they had done... so he invited him to Oxford to fill in the blanks... In time, he hated his eccentricities, namely his Hindu fatalism - if he got sick, refused to see a doctor, calling it karma, or whatever... Once he was in a cab with a professor who looked at a license plate and said casuaaly, What a boring number. And Ramanujan replied something like, Actually it is an interesting number, being prime... It was like four digits. ... I think he might have made some contribution in astrophysics.. no, not Chandreshkar, but Ramanujan... I don't know... my memory comes and goes.",0,false,0,,,,,,

I would expect Dev Patel to have acted differently for this role than what he has. From what I see he hardly has the accent of a person in the early 1900's educated in India. Even his mannerisms are very confident. All this would have not been there in a person from early 1900's in India which had little exposure to sources of developing the accent and mannerisms of the west. While his acting may be good it sure does not bring out Ramanajun as he would have been a hundred years ago.,55,true,20,,,,,,

Ramachandra Rao, the district collector for Nellore and the secretary of the Indian Mathematical Society.[38][39][40] Ramachandra Rao was impressed by Ramanujan's research but doubted that it was actually his own work. Ramanujan mentioned a correspondence he had with Professor Saldhana, a notable Bombay mathematician, in which Saldhana expressed a lack of understanding of his work but concluded that he was not a phoney.[41] Ramanujan's friend, C. V. Rajagopalachari, persisted with Ramachandra Rao and tried to quell any doubts over Ramanujan's academic integrity. Rao agreed to give him another chance, and he listened as Ramanujan discussed elliptic integrals, hypergeometric series, and his theory of divergent series, which Rao said ultimately ""converted"" him to a belief in Ramanujan's mathematical brilliance.[41] When Rao asked him what he wanted, Ramanujan replied that he needed some work and financial support. Rao consented and sent him to Madras. He continued his mathematical research with Rao's financial aid taking care of his daily needs. Ramanujan, with the help of Ramaswamy Aiyer, had his work published in the Journal of the Indian Mathematical Society",1

Hinduism or Sanatan Dharma is a peace loving religion teaching respect and harmony, love for animals and such other good practices. The holy Hindu books are completely based on science and did not in any way promote spreading religion or conversion. Even the shlokas or Vedas constructed thousands of years ago contain scientific facts which are being discovered by present day scientists. There is so much to learn from this religion and God is a very small part of it. Religions such as Buddhism which also aim at enlightenment of the soul and holistic development and preach harmony stem from Hinduism.This all changed after Mughals came to India. The medieval era of India is dark because it was tainted by the inflow of these outsiders. They wiped out all the intellectual development that happened in this country before that and India became a poverty stricken illiterate country. If Hindus are still so trusting and gullible and believe that our benefit lies in this country being 'sickular', think again. But I admit it's difficult to let go of the values ingrained in us. We were raised with morals like 'atithi devo bhava' which also means 'the guest is equivalent to God'. It's high time these guests leave.",2

When i was a kid i was fascinated by hypnotism, so i had this book about self hypnosis and i got myself into a state of trance so it is totally possible to meditate on your own. why do we need a guru? well, when we were in school we had teachers to simplyfy things, they guided us through academics as we had zero knowledge about studies and they also disciplined us... likewise when some beginner meditates a lot of questions arise as he doesnt have an idea of what meditation actually is (trust me, meditation is one of the things that can only be known through experience), questions like am i doing it right? am i breathing right etc etc etc. all these questions can only be answered by a guru... Also i have seen people meditating on their own and coming to a conclusion that it only calms ones mind, which is just a part of it, meditation can do miraculous things. Gurus also help you work on a certain chakra like they help open it up and once its open you can access it any time you want while meditating... Also i have seen people just drifing away from this world in such a trance that it becomes hard to bring them into the normal conciousness (dont be scared you wont die but if your family finds you in such state you will be in trouble XD)...

Because he was self taught, you never knew if what ever thing he was using if he saw it somewhere, if he proved it somewhere, or if it was an unproven theorem. To this day this kind of problem happens when gigantic proofs arise because of the sheer size a mistake is bound to happen, specially when referencing other proofs. So the problem was that he needed people to verify his theorems, the sheer amount of work was intimidating for anyone, and the purpose of his work was vague, well, because he only cared about pure mathematics not necessarily eventual applications. He was like fermat, but without the rubbing of eventual interesting applications on people's faces or the gloating that would at least make people want to disprove or prove him. The reason someone took really good interest was the sheer amount of obscure mathematics he referenced and how they all weirdly came together. As one guy said ""if someone imagined this, it must be true"" because by no other means but reality someone could have imagined something so non-intuitive. And interestingly he was an easier proof than many like him, everything he conjectured (intentionally or not) has been proven true. His work was very odd, but not as hard to prove as one would have though looking at it, which makes me thankful he existed, He was one of the people that if he had not lived we wouldn't get anything like it so soon. And pretty much all he has done is absurdly useful, it's like he invented the electrical engine in the iron age and in a way that wasn't all that hard to reproduce or verify.",2

Sure, in some cases religions have been ok with science...in many other cases, they haven't.

Abrahamic faiths do fall short in the exploration of science.

However, my argument is fueled by the fact that very early spiritual exploration and religious activities brought Mankind out of it's cycle of Eat, Sleep repeat. Considering with all the spare time that was brought upon by the Agricultural Revolution (you could also say that was a cause), people created faith to reason with things they didn't know worked. As time advanced, people kept their curiosity high enough so they started experimenting or doing math.

Confucian China purposely told people to go out and discover what the world had to offer w/o any means off attributing it to any divinity, and the Catholic Pope today even is in support of climate change research. And stem cell research ethics goes beyond religion, many irreligious people are against it as well; you can't put correlation to causation that it's religion that makes people against stem cell.
