PROS: Laughably tries to justify brainless Christmas materialism denies that Christianity co-opted Pagan traditions. Writing for token black character is offensively bad and at times verges on entertaining. 'Actor' who plays Kirk Cameron's sister looks like a meth addict. Santa is portrayed as both violent and rapey. CONS: Ssssssssllllllllloooooowwwwww...some characters, especially the Jewwy-looking guy who plays Kirk Cameron's brother-in-law, deliver their lines with long, unnecessary pauses between words.

Consider this, do you think it was by chance that this movie was rated the worst movie of all time? Yahushua(Jesus) is giving you a sign, please understand it. Since Yahushua(Jesus) was not born on dec 25th it was never about Yahushua(Jesus) to begin with and its a perpetual lie telling anyone he was. The simplicity of that alone should be a red flag. You have come off the path, and the teaching of this movie are very dangerous. Read below........ Exodus 32: 5And when Aaron saw it, he built an altar before it; and Aaron made proclamation, and said, To morrow is a feast to the LORD. 6And they rose up early on the morrow, and offered burnt offerings, and brought peace offerings; and the people sat down to eat and to drink, and rose up to play. Moses Informed of Israel's Sin 7And the LORD said unto Moses, Go, get thee down; for thy people, which thou broughtest out of the land of Egypt, have corrupted themselves: 8They have turned aside quickly out of the way which I commanded them: Mark 7: 6He answered and said unto them, Well hath Esaias prophesied of you hypocrites, as it is written, This people honoureth me with their lips, but their heart is far from me. 7Howbeit in vain do they worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men. 8For laying aside the commandment of God, ye hold the tradition of men, 2 Peter 3: 16As also in all his epistles, speaking in them of these things; in which are some things hard to be understood, which they that are unlearned and unstable wrest, as they do also the other scriptures, unto their own destruction. 17Ye therefore, beloved, seeing ye know these things before, beware lest ye also, being led away with the error of the wicked, fall from your own stedfastness. Matthew 5: 19Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments, and shall teach men so, he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven: but whosoever shall do and teach them, the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven. Deuteronomy 18: 9When thou art come into the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee, thou shalt not learn to do after the abominations of those nations. Deuteronomy 12: 1These are the statutes and judgments, which ye shall observe to do in the land, which the LORD God of thy fathers giveth thee to possess it, all the days that ye live upon the earth. 2Ye shall utterly destroy all the places, wherein the nations which ye shall possess served their gods, upon the high mountains, and upon the hills, and under every green tree: 3And ye shall overthrow their altars, and break their pillars, and burn their groves with fire; and ye shall hew down the graven images of their gods, and destroy the names of them out of that place. 4Ye shall not do so unto the LORD your God. Ezekiel 8: 14Then he brought me to the door of the gate of the LORD'S house which was toward the north; and, behold, there sat women weeping for Tammuz. 15Then said he unto me, Hast thou seen this, O son of man? turn thee yet again, and thou shalt see greater abominations than these. 16And he brought me into the inner court of the LORD'S house, and, behold, at the door of the temple of the LORD, between the porch and the altar, were about five and twenty men, with their backs toward the temple of the LORD, and their faces toward the east; and they worshipped the sun toward the east. 17Then he said unto me, Hast thou seen this, O son of man? Is it a light thing to the house of Judah that they commit the abominations which they commit here? for they have filled the land with violence, and have returned to provoke me to anger: and, lo, they put the branch to their nose. 18Therefore will I also deal in fury: mine eye shall not spare, neither will I have pity: and though they cry in mine ears with a loud voice, yet will I not hear them. Deuteronomy 4: 2Ye shall not add unto the word which I command you, neither shall ye diminish ought from it, that ye may keep the commandments of the LORD your God which I command you.

When you only stick to your lib/atheist propaganda books, shows, etc where these claims are constantly reiterated, I guess you start to believe they are valid. However, nobody claimed Jesus was definitely born on December 25. It's unknown exactly why this date was chosen. One theory is that The Annunciation (Mary being told of her pregnancy with Jesus) took place on March 25 so his birth would be around December 25. Another theory is that December 25 was chosen to counteract pagan celebrations around this time. Still others suggest it was chosen around this time because it was Winter, days were shorter and thus people had more time for celebration, festivals, etc. That so-called ""pagan"" traditions (Christmas Tree, Yule Log) may have infiltrated Christmas is irrelevant because the point of Christmas remains to celebrate Christ. It's like saying because the USA observes Mexican traditions, like Cinco de Mayo, the USA is really Mexican. In fact, the term ""Christmas"" comes from & means ""Christ Mass.""",0,false,0,,,,,,

If you ignore the message it still looks like a shitty movie. Everyone including the extras look and sound like they're over acting. The set for the living room doesn't look homey. The floor looks like white plastic the decorations look like someone just haphazardly threw them in there. Santa looks fake as fuck and the kids aren't fooled by it. The lighting is way too bright in the house. Unless they're lighting their house with football stadium lights nobody's house is that bright. This leads to problems in that it washes out the actors' faces, and gives it a fake feel. When movies look fake audiences don't like it because subconsciously they are comparing it to real life so that they can find something to identify with to make it seem real. Meaning the more like someone's home a house looks the more someone will like it because their brain associates it with their own memories. The car part reminds me of a sonic commercial. A lot of the things he's saying are right ""Jesus wasn't born in December"" and ""pagan symbols"" I don't get why he's pissed off. If he knows that Jesus wasn't born in December why is he celebrating Jesus' birthday at that time of year. If he knows that these are pagan symbols you'd think he'd know that Christians stole Yule from the Pagans. More stadium lights for the birth of Jesus cut away. It's not even ""it's so glorious Jesus is born"" it's Mary is sitting in the middle of the road and a car is coming. After the ""Amen"" literally all of the extras look into the camera instead of at the man on the floor where real people would naturally look. Also is nobody going to help him off of the floor. Yay you just slid across the floor possibly ruining someone's gift we're going to celebrate that and stare off into space while you get yourself up.

They are destroying the foundations of our faith. They make people think that Jesus Christ wasn't even real (which historically he was real, wether or not he was the messiah is up to people's opinion) I highly doubt though that within 20 years Christianity will die out. Someone here wrote that knowledge and logic will destroy Christianity, however that is only the case for ""Young-Earth Creationism"". Young Earthers, in my opinion, are not true Christians, they are ignorant, cruel, and close-minded people, they are basically their own religion. As much as anti-theists deny it, most Christians accept evolution, and the big bang theory. In fact the person who first thought of the big bang theory was ""Georges Lemaitre"" who was Christian. Of course there are people who want to deny evolution because they have no true understanding of the bible. The catholic church has accepted evolution for decades now. In fact The Pope recently said even that ""Evolution and big bang are true, and that God isn't a magician who waves his wand"" Also God isn't a Genie, so he can't just do every wish you command. I hope Pope Francis restores Christianity, because once he dies people will always remember him for his love, peacefulness, and kindness, which is the Christian thing to do. But nobody will remember Ken Ham, or Richard Dawkins, or Ray Comfort. Because they are just ignorant. The pope even said there will be a possibilty of life on other planets, and this is a guy who's read the bible over 500 times, who is a theoligion, a linguist, and a person who has understood the many interpretations of the bible.

z13kizwb4trbwzltf221s1rqasqxi3qpt04,GhostofaSiren,1 year ago,1443934938665,"Should Christians Observe Holidays? The question of observing holidays is addressed in God’s word. After all, many early Christians had recently departed their Jewish faith. What were they to do with the many holidays that their friends and family still observed? Some chose to make a complete separation from their past traditions, others put those customs to use. “Who are you to judge another's servant? To his own master he stands or falls. Indeed, he will be made to stand, for God is able to make him stand. One person esteems one day above another; another esteems every day alike. Let each be fully convinced in his own mind. He who observes the day, observes it to the Lord; and he who does not observe the day, to the Lord he does not observe it. He who eats, eats to the Lord, for he gives God thanks; and he who does not eat, to the Lord he does not eat, and gives God thanks. For none of us lives to himself, and no one dies to himself. For if we live, we live to the Lord; and if we die, we die to the Lord. Therefore, whether we live or die, we are the Lord's” (Romans 14:4-8). Paul’s words are puzzling to those who know how forcefully Paul argued against bringing Jewish customs into the church. However, recall that Paul observed Jewish customs at times. In Acts 21:20-26 you can read were Paul complied with the ordinances for purification even though the law of Moses was no longer in effect. Paul explains this in I Corinthians 9:19-22, “For though I am free from all men, I have made myself a servant to all, that I might win the more; and to the Jews I became as a Jew, that I might win Jews; to those who are under the law, as under the law, that I might win those who are under the law; to those who are without law, as without law (not being without law toward God, but under law toward Christ), that I might win those who are without law; to the weak I became as weak, that I might win the weak. I have become all things to all men, that I might by all means save some.” Paul’s goal was to teach people about Christ, yet the people he approached all have personal biases and expectations of what constitutes religious practice. So long as those practices did not violate what a Christian must do, Paul was willing to personally conform himself to those expectations in order to have opportunity to teach people. He strongly stated that it was wrong to bind these foreign practices on the church, but as an individual he had some liberty. In other words, if a Jew came out of Judaism and desired to continue to celebrate Passover with his family, such was not wrong as an individual. As a Christian he knows that the requirement for observing Passover had ended when Jesus died on the cross (Colossians 2:14). Thus to him it is not a religious feast, but a secular one. Yet, by keeping it he is accepted in the Jewish community and has opportunities to teach about Christ. The actual keeping of the feast does not violate any command of Christ. Another Jew coming into Christianity enjoys the freedom that it provides and decides to make a complete break from Judaism. He chooses to not to follow any of the past customs. Should he look down at his fellow Christian who is still observing some of the Jewish customs? “But why do you judge your brother? Or why do you show contempt for your brother? For we shall all stand before the judgment seat of Christ. For it is written: ""As I live, says the LORD, Every knee shall bow to Me, And every tongue shall confess to God."" So then each of us shall give account of himself to God.” (Romans 14:10-12). I’m sure that some ex-Jews had a difficult time eating pork after a lifetime of avoiding it. But the truth is that it doesn’t matter if a person, as an individual, decides not eat ham. “I know and am convinced by the Lord Jesus that there is nothing unclean of itself; but to him who considers anything to be unclean, to him it is unclean” (Romans 14:14). Should then, the person who chooses to follow his old customs look down on his fellow Christian who does not do so? “So let no one judge you in food or in drink, or regarding a festival or a new moon or sabbaths, which are a shadow of things to come, but the substance is of Christ” (Colossians 2:16-17). It is a two-way street. “Let not him who eats despise him who does not eat, and let not him who does not eat judge him who eats; for God has received him” (Romans 14:3). The key is the fact that neither person is violating the laws of God. “Do you have faith? Have it to yourself before God. Happy is he who does not condemn himself in what he approves” (Romans 14:22). But such liberty in individual choice does not translate into new laws for the church. While an ex-Jew might choose not eat pork, he cannot bind on all Christians a ban from pork. “For every creature of God is good, and nothing is to be refused if it is received with thanksgiving” (I Timothy 4:4). A person who decides to enter a synagogue and join in the Sabbath observance cannot tell other Christians that they must observe the Sabbath as well. Therefore, we reach the point where we need to ask, can Christians observe secular holidays? Many brethren observe the Fourth of July, Memorial Day, and Mother’s Day without a second thought as to whether they are right or wrong. These days are merely days set aside to enjoy special occasions. But like the old Jewish customs, it would be wrong to bring these secular holidays into the church. For example, Mother’s Day is slowly being pulled into the denominations and becoming a part of their religious practices. If I chose to remember my mother on a particular day of the year, that is my business, but I cannot create a special day for the church to remember mothers because God did not authorize it. But what about Christmas? It began in idolatry and false religious practice, so how can a Christian participate in it? The question is: does it continue to be viewed as idolatry? As an example, the days of our week are named after false gods. Should Christians not use those names because of their connection to idolatry? No, because no one makes the connection these days. To make an appointment on Tuesday doesn’t cause anyone to assume that you are a pagan. The fact that Christmas originated in pagan and false religious practice ought to make us pause and consider. But the same question needs to be asked: does my participating in the celebration cause others to make the wrong conclusion about my beliefs? I doubt anyone today would conclude that those celebrating Christmas are pagan idolaters. However, since Christmas and Easter are recognized as religious holidays, some observing us may think we are also keeping these holidays as a religious requirement. This could be a cause of concern. So, consider this: when you see decorative lights on a house, do you assume the owners are celebrating Christmas as a religious holiday? I think most would honestly say, “No.” I know atheist and Jews who put up decorated trees and give out gifts. Thus Christmas is no longer strongly associated with Christianity. In fact, those in denominations are complaining that Christmas has lost its religious significance. That is why so many are chanting slogans, such as “Put Christ back into Christmas.” When people ask me what I’m doing to celebrate Easter at the congregation, I say, “The same thing we do every Sunday.” The puzzled looks give me an opportunity to show them the passages proving that Christ’s death is to be remembered every Sunday. Yet, we still decorate our home with pastel items and hide brightly colored eggs for the children. Nothing religious is connected with Easter in our home, but as a social custom we enjoy the holiday. We are able to enjoy Christmas as well without turning it into a religious holiday. I don’t have stars on my tree or a nativity scene in my yard. I can sing carols, but I skip the ones that speak of Bethlehem, angels, mangers, wise men, holy nights, and shepherds. I leave religion out of my holidays because God did not authorize them, but it doesn’t mean I must cross the holidays off my calendar. What about my brothers who strongly object to certain holiday observances? “Therefore let us not judge one another anymore, but rather resolve this, not to put a stumbling block or a cause to fall in our brother's way” (Romans 14:13). I’m going to try my best not to cause offense. If I know someone objects to Christmas, I’m not going to invite them over for a turkey dinner on December 25th. There are plenty of other occasions to get together without my making things awkward for them. The instructions found in Romans 14 are often misapplied to situations they were never intended. But we mustn’t forget to learn and use those laws in their proper context.",0,false,0,,,,,,

Honestly, I'd give the movie credit for having at least one unlikable Christian (Such as a middle-aged curmudgeon who screams at his lesbian neighbors) and a likable atheist. The film's message was basically: Atheists are just angry at God. Atheists cannot be angry with something they don't believe in. At the end, Radisson just gets killed. Josh does not offer him his hand after he breaks down due to the death of his mother. I mean, simply God 'took away' his mother and he did not get at least a cliché 'God works in mysterious ways' from Josh towards Radisson, he just bounced back to the ironic and brutal 'Why do you hate something you deny'.

Say you got into an argument with a friend, your significant other cheats on you, someone murders one of your loved ones, or any other scenario that leaves you mad at the person. I don't think anyone's solution is to just assert that they don't exist. Why should this apply to God? Most people who arrive at atheism got there through logical thinking. They found lack of evidence to support the existence of God and find the teachings and outlandish claims to be too far fetched to believe. Horrible things and wonderful things happen to people on a daily basis. There is no deep meaning behind it. It is either random or just the result of circumstances. I think it is kind of foolish to think everything happens for a reason, God works in mysterious ways, or it was all part of God's plan. Sure, it might give some people some comfort to believe this but that doesn't make it true. I'd rather go with the truth than a comforting lie.",1

This isn't just the worst christmas movie or worst christian movie, it Is thee WORST. MOVIE. EVER. CREATED. It's supposed to have a comedic undertone but I don't think a single person laughed the entire time. Even my friend thought it was terrible and she was the target audience. It's simply an hour of apologist propaganda. It's chock full of historical inaccuracies and other absurdities. The logic used in this movie is like trying to prove New Jersey exists by saying you were born on a monday. If you have ever seen Kirk Cameron talk about bananas, it's like changing banana to christmas and then making it into a movie. I have never uttered the phrase, ""are you fucking serious"" so many times in the matter of 60 minutes. If you want a movie that lectures you and treats you like you're the biggest imbecile on the face of the planet then this movie is for you.

I love the music (even the religious songs), the food, and the presence of family, as I grew up a Christian. I have no problem with the term ""Merry Christmas"" I say it every year. However, I also say ""Happy Holidays"" to people I don't know personally, because they may be of another tradition( there are many winter season holidays) and I live in America where many traditions take place. Saying ""Happy Holidays"" is not an attack on Christmas, it is respect for those of other traditions. I don't understand why this is so hard to understand. However, I have studied the history of how these ""Christmas"" stories came about. Jesus's Birthday Despite Christmas being associated with the birth of Jesus Christ, there is no biblical passage or other evidence establishing Jesus's date of birth. In early-to-mid 4th century, The Western Christian Church set the date of Christmas to December 25 as a means to rival existing solstice celebrations, and was later also adopted in the East. While there is no established date for the birth of Jesus, the following passage from Luke 2:8-12[3] seem to suggest that he was born during the lambing season: ""And there were shepherds living out in the fields nearby, keeping watch over their flocks at night. An angel of the Lord appeared to them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were terrified. But the angel said to them, “Do not be afraid. I bring you good news that will cause great joy for all the people. Today in the town of David a Savior has been born to you; he is the Messiah, the Lord. This will be a sign to you: You will find a baby wrapped in cloths and lying in a manger.”"" Natalis Invicti Natalis Invicti (""birthday of the unconquered one"") was a festival celebrating the rebirth of the sun, Sol Invictus (""Invincible Sun""), the official sun god of the Roman Empire. Scholars argue that the festival was placed on the date of the winter solstice as the sun would seemingly reverse its retreat and thereby prove itself unconquered. Early Christian writers connected the rebirth of the sun with the birth of Jesus Christ, and the festival is believed to be responsible for the date of Christmas. Saturnalia Saturnalia is an ancient Roman celebration of Saturn, the youngest of the Titans and father of the gods in Roman and Greek mythology. While originally only celebrated for a day, it grew to a week-long celebration starting at December 17 and ending at December 23. Besides the public rites involved in the festival, there were also a series of holidays and customs celebrated privately. The celebrations included a school holiday, gift-giving and a special market. Yule Yule is a winter festival taking place on December 25, and was initially celebrated by the Germanic people as a pagan religious festival. The festival was later absorbed into the Christian festival of Christmas. Customs such as the Yule log, the Yule goat, the Christmas ham, wassailing etc. all come from Yule. Controversies War on Christmas The term War on Christmas gained traction in the early 2000s, thanks to conservative commentators such as Fox News's Bill O'Reilly. The term is used to denote the alleged censorship of Christmas, and how the use of terms and phrases such as Xmas and Happy Holidays are, as Fox News host John Gibson puts it, a ""liberal plot to ban the sacred Christmas holiday"". Scientist and former White House senior policy analyst Jeff Schweitzer stated that ""there is no war"", and ""Christians like Bill O'Reilly have declared war on religious freedom, demanding that the United States convert to a Christian nation"", referring to their insistence that stores and the like should use language which is explicitly Christian.",5,true,13,,,,,,

z12sjpszjwqiudckb23ycdpggnqag120k,Maria Athena,1 year ago (edited),1443934954514,"""'Happy Holidays' or 'Seasons Greetings'. . . whatever that means. . ."" Well, I can see how this may be confusing, but let's take this as a question of semantics. ""Happy"" or ""Greetings"" (in this context) are commonly used lexical units to wish well to individuals and/or express an amicably-natured salutation, ex: ""Happy Birthday, Chuck!"" or ""Greetings from Chicago"". ""Holiday"" can be seen as an umbrella term for any day that celebrates an event, idea, deity, etc and that is given special status by/in a state, country, town, religion, culture, etc., which are often based off recorded history, cultural/religious memory, etc. and differ according to region, religion, etc.; for specific examples of ""Holidays"" see Wikipedia or anyone you know who is familiar with this concept. ""Happy Holidays"" is used by one individual to express well-wishing, joyousness and sheer merriment to another individual on a non-specific level, based off the presumption that the receiver will celebrate/celebrates any of a number of days which would be classified as a ""Holiday"" at the given time of year. ""Season"" denotes a stretch of time varying in length, but in this case specifically refers (at least in some Western cultures) to a brief period of time (sp. December/January) where several holidays (see above definition) are being actively celebrated by people in the area, community, etc. The phrase ""Seasons Greetings"" is a not uncommon way of recognizing that enough people celebrate any one or more of the holidays celebrated at this often festive time of year for it not to be a weird thing to say. These phrases exist because people come from different backgrounds and celebrate different things and have different ideologies and therefore it should not be assumed that everyone is on the same page when it comes to who celebrates what and why. This from a polyglot. (For the record, this was just a sarcastic rant, not something prepared for scholarly criticism.) :)",3,false,0,,,,,,

z12lsjxrwtqcdbaru04cjjn51umhsheyn1c,Madeleine,1 year ago (edited),1443934959883,"I believe that Christmas is a combination of religious symbolism and pagan symbolism. Many traditions like mistletoe or a Christmas tree are traditions passed down over generations that aren't related to Christ's birth. Other religious symbols, like the Nativity scene, or certain carols like ""O Holy Night"", ""What Child Is This?"", and ""Away in a Manger"" have been passed down over generations and can be credited to Christianity. This means that for Christians in America, we get to celebrate Christmas in the way that it was intended for us, centered around Christ's birth and giving of ourselves. I agree that we as Christians should start giving back more on Christmas rather than making our Christmas lists and shopping too much. This year I started doing that by helping the homeless on Christmas Day. Atheists are free to celebrate Christmas too, for what it means to them. Hanging lights on their house, decorating a Christmas tree, hanging stockings, spending time with family... They are still free to enjoy their traditions as well. We should stop arguing over ""who stole Christmas from who"" and ""if it's really religious or not"". I say we all just enjoy this time of year, whether you are religious or not, and we spend time giving of ourselves and enjoying time with family in peace and harmony. We should just enjoy the season in peace instead of fighting over who owns the holiday. Believe what you believe, do traditions with your family, and let others do the same, even if you disagree. This is the best time of the year where we get to be thankful for everything we have. Christians: We can be thankful that we even get to celebrate Christ's birth in America. Atheists: You get to be thankful that you have freedom to practice your traditions as well. Peace be with you all this holiday season.",1,false,0,,,,,,

Its origins are pagan (do a bit of research on the origin of Christmas and how it was introduced into Christianity), and none of the traditions and symbolism is biblical, but much of it is taken from pagan cultures. Christmas is like a mish-mash of pagan traditions (many of which go blatantly against what the Bible commands). Moreover, there isn't even one single example of the followers of Jesus celebrating his birth or commanding others to do so. (Of course from a scholarly point of view the entire narrative of Jesus' birth is most probably completely fictional, invented and written down almost 100 years after it allegedly happened, but that's an entire topic in itself.) ""Put Christ back in Christmas"" is quite a misnomer because Christ has never been in Christmas. Personally I'd recommend doing the exact opposite: Remove ""Christ"" from Christmas. Excise all religious baggage from it, and celebrate it for what it is: A joyous occasion of family reunion, socialization, gift-giving and appreciation.",117,true,38,,,,,,

Now to me I guess its more of a comfort to think that once we die there is a possibility that you might (even through some sort of simulated memories) see a loved one rather than the alternative. Finally to tackle whether its a bad thing or a good thing, to me its not bad nor its good because the world as I know it is gone when I die however for others who are left behind that were part of my life and who cared for me for them it is a bad thing, because well it is a loss of a loved one.

Now, obviously I speak from a stance of ignorance, as do we all. I cannot say with certainty he was real or not, but the proof and logic lends to him being a real figure. I simply find it ludicrous,as to what other explanation there is for Jesus? I don't care if it goes against your beliefs, or you don't like it. If it's truth it's truth, and to go against it for said reasons makes you a Christian's equal.. Just bear that in mind. Simple logic garners dismissal of a majority of other claims. And for the record, incase you didn't catch it, still not a Christian. Was. But no longer. So let's look at claims against him: Is he made up? Doubtful, the crucifixion, baptism.. If he was made up it seems a bit backwards to have a ""sinless man"" be baptized which was for ""remission of sin"". Also, his words are kinda against the norm of thinking at the time. I just can't think of alot of people this happens to in history. If this was a common occurrence, it would make sense to use such a claim.. But it just seems... Kinda fuckin dumb? (and by common occurrence, you can easily come up with examples, but it'd take a while to explain exactly what I meant.) ""Anti-Roman Propoganda"" Idk.. If he was exclusively made up for that reason... You think you'd see WAYY more of that in his teachings, or as a extremely common theme. I mean, he actually was attempted to be tricked by the Jews into inciting a rebellion against the romans and got out of it.. (When they asked him if they should pay taxes and his answer was ""render unto ceasar what is caesars and render unto God what is God's"") ""He was a legend made up by Romans to quell Jews"" Haha, huh? How was a man claiming to be their One God gonna calm them down? How was a man preaching against the hypocritical figures of the jewish leaders (who in the Biblical scriptures atleast, didn't want trouble with Romans) helping Romans? How was painting a Roman Leader as someone who lets a murderer go and crucifies an innocent man, helping the Romans? As you can see, that argument pretty much completely disregards to Biblical text. Not to mention what happened to early Christians.. They were massacred and persecuted terribly by the Roman Emperors, before Constantine made it a mandatory religion.. (again, how does that help Rome? Christianity helped destroy Rome.) The only real argument against him is basically discrediting the Biblical gospels entirely, but that takes a lot to do. Don't get me wrong, easy to disprove them as ""Innerant Word of God' but to completely ignore them is stupid. The texts were supposedly written from first hand accounts of people who knew him and traveled with him, even at the time of their writing the writers DIED for said beliefs, and the writing was passed around and believed to be inspired by God even then. As you can see, it's actually harder to disprove him then to prove him. I've given you some proof and logical conclusions against your two's opinions in a respectful manner. Now do likewise and provide me some sources, and logical conclusions against my opinion in a respectful manner.",0

You absolutely, CANNOT have morals without religion. A moral approach based on science is worthless, because, according to science, even consciousness is an illusion. If consciousness is an illusion (isn't real), then there is no intrinsic value to it. Therefore, life of any kind has no intrinsic value!! Atheists will then ironically try to preach Humanism, in which morality is derived from the values of any given culture. This is fucking stupid, because as I said earlier, without any inherent value in human life, what would guide anyone's behavior? ""A social need for acceptance"" is science's explanation....But it isn't really an explanation, because it boils down to, ""What are my values?"" ""They're the same as everyone else's."" ""Why?"" ""Because that's what I've been taught."" ""Why?"" ""Because the situation my culture is in lends itself to those values."" But situations change. If you internalize the guidance of the Bible and the peace that comes from knowing God, your values don't change based on the situation; you operate throughout your life with integrity, regardless of what other are doing, and virtually every Christian who truly practices can tell you that it brings inner peace and inner power to an incredible degree Religion's most dedicated followers come from those who think we need to have deeper values than those which so happen to be socially acceptable on this day, with this group of people. Religion is also for people who are disgusted by the scientific community's unspoken and persistent assertion that the human experience is worthless. Fuck Bill Nye, fuck Neil DeGrasse Tyson, fuck Stephen Hawking, and fuck Richard Dawkins. I'm tired of those assholes telling me that everything I experience is just an illusion. Go read some real authors, like Origen, like Descartes, like Einstein even (he was agnostic but truly open-minded).

No amount of rambling on about your sadistic man in the sky will disprove that. My morality comes from common sense and human empathy.

In fact, that same book spends a few passages detailing the logistics and mechanics of slave trade.) I also derive my morality from evolution. Contrary to what you ignorantly hold to be true, morality is evolutionary advantageous, as it allows an intelligent species to have a set of values by which to order and structuralize their society for the common good. By making an absolute statement such as the one you've made (and I quote: "" You ABSOLUTELY cannot have morality without religion), you imply that nobody before the year 0 had moral values.

I thought you'd pick up on that. 2. Do you even know what Agnosticism is? It's the middle fence between Atheism and Theism, but is much closer to Atheism if anything. He explicitly said that be believed the word ""God"", as commonly used by the masses, was just an expression of human ignorance and a desire to feel special. He didn't believe in transcendence, nor did he believe in an afterlife. He simply realized that there ""must"" have been an original source of creation. Perhaps an everlasting, omnipotent force which created the universe for some unknown purpose, then stopped concerning itslef with petty human matters. Unlike you, he wasn't arrogant enough to assert that the creator of the universe was concerned with him, or human morality, or that be revealed himself to others, without any evidence. 3. The book of revelations that I assume you're referring to should best be renames to ""Book of Obvious Predictions"". Everything it mentions (hunger, war, kickers and scoffers, etc) have always been around. Our time period doesn't have anything exclusive to it that discerns it from other time periods. Here's a challenge: point me to one time in recorded human history when the things predicted in the bible WEREN'T happening. 4. I don't understand how you can claim that the creator of the universe, in all his glory, decided to reveal to you how to be ""good"" or ""bad"". You are arrogant enough to believe that he made the entirety of the universe for your personal pleasure, and that he gives a shit regarding what you do with your genitals in private (and other ridiculous biblical prohibitions.) 5. One of the primary ways for me to discern between good and bad is by envisioning the consequences. Every action is carried out by people because of a deep-rooted fear of consequences. I restrain from killing, because I fear: guilt, legal repercussions, social outcasting, etc. My motives for doing good are generally a mixture of a fear of consequences, and a desire for reward. I give charity because I fear: guilt (for not giving), and social rejection by those who observed me not giving when urged to. I also anticipate praise (for when I do it), and that warm feeling you get from seeing a smile on a homeless man's face. 6. I didn't insult your intelligence. I just called you ignorant. Notice the difference. 7. You do realize that Stephen Hawking now holds the same position that was once held by Sir Isaac Newton, right? He knows more about the universe than you probaky ever will. I'm not trying to resort to the authority fallacy here. I'm just reminding you not to reject the works of a living genius, and not to pontificate in matters you don't fully understand yet. 8. A great example of morality without god is Bill Gates (I'm sure you've heard of him.) He donated hundreds of millions (maybe even billions) to charity, out of pure kindness. He's also an atheist.",0

It's just a holiday that is made to get you to spend money there's no real religious property to it. You shouldn't be trying to shove your religion down other peoples throats like that. The world does not revolve around Christians other people have opinions too you know. Not every holiday that we celebrate has to be religious. Can't we have a bit of fun and just throw more money out the window buying useless toys we'll never play with.

He was born to a wealthy family, but sold all of his riches and gave money/gifts to the poor. His tradition carried on for centuries and he transformed into Santa Claus. It's certainly true that Christmas, today, has changed a great deal. However, it's still a time for family, for recognizing/worshiping Jesus, and definitely still a time for charitable giving.

Why did we view them from that angle? It's just weird and jarring. It doesn't look artistic. And the sets, Jesus Christ, the sets! They look like they're from the 1980's!

He's earned everything he's getting and his film deserves to be mocked and insulted. People shouldn't have to see his movie before they reserve judgment and they're not dishonest for insulting him just because they haven't seen it. It's not half obvious what the films going to be like. The acting is poor, it has a token black guy who acts exactly like black people in blaxploitation films do, the main Character is trying to ""save"" Christmas from people thinking Christmas is based on stolen pagan traditions which is actually a violation of known facts (Christmas really IS based on pagan mythology, Jesus birthday was actually sometime in the fall) and finally one of the other issues the film is blowing out of proportion is the fact that some people say happy holidays instead of merry Christmas, I mean come on man. It's a sad and pathetic film and no one should have to sit through the entire thing if they don't want to just to meet YOUR standards.

Heck, I think there were already a handful since the turn of the century alone. So, it is the reasonable position to reserve judgement and allow for the possibility than to outright negate it and assert positively that he never existed. When you assert in the positive that he did not exist - yes, that's an assertion. Even a negation is an assertion - it is up to you to provide evidence since you are making the positive claim. The burden of proof does not fall on the one reserving judgement and making no claim either way. I understand a few people google a few fallacies and think they are Bertrand Russell, but logic is much more involved than a few fallacies, but I digress. I personally don't feel that he did exist even as a man by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, but I would never make the positive assertion that he did not exist or that some nut thinking he was the son of god existed since there are at least a handful alive today. It's probably a moot point anyway. I think what we must argue here is whether or not the son of god or god existed, never mind a crazy man, because crazy men have existed, do exist, and always will exist. The question is whether or not some crazy man had dealings with god, and that is a claim the needs extraordinary evidence. That's the claim that is absurd. If someone says, ""do you think Jesus existed."" I say, ""surely some man named Jesus existed but was he the chosen son of god capable of miracles, and to that I say, 'absolutely not.' There is no evidence for gods yet much to contradict the existence of a god so there would be no reason to suppose a ""chosen son"" of a god. If and when you can show the existence of a god, we can then debate the validity of a chosen son of god. Until that time, while there may have well been a crazed man named Jesus, there is no reason to suppose he was as he claimed.""",1

I talked to some historians, (you know, the ones who supported my theories). I used them as my MAIN SOURCES - not that silly ol' Bible. And when people question me about this, I tell then, ""Hey! I used to be pagan. So why not continue doing pagan things in YHWHs name!? Kirk, people that follow Torah are not the dumb! We know what we believe and we stand for it. I have a question to all those people that think we ""should save"" Christmas. Is Jesus Gods Son? Wouldn't Jesus follow His Fathers Law? The Torah.

There are dissenting ideas about why the date was chosen (e.g., some say that it has to do with a belief that the conception happened 9 months earlier) since it is not believed he was born in December (I think currently there is some evidence he was born in April? but don't quote me on that one). The celebrating of Christmas started in the 4th century when Christianity was made the official state belief of the Roman Empire (after years of Christian persecution). Because it was no longer being persecuted this is when Christianity started to flourish and they started to really define their beliefs, and also started to celebrate the birth of Christ. Through time the various already established traditions surrounding the winter equinox, etc started to attach themselves to the holiday. So everything you said about the origins of the tree and yule log and all that are accurate, but the word Christmas is to celebrate the birth of Christ. I do agree the best way to celebrate it, whatever you celebrate it for, is by helping your fellow man though, since to me the holiday is all about the spirit of giving!

What we should be saying is that the traditions observed at Christmas have nothing to do with Jesus, because they're pagan in origin, but like any other celebration, the event itself has all the meaning the people observing it are willing to give it. On the other hand, Christians are not engaging us on the argument we're intending to make. Saying ""Christmas is about Christ because it's in the name"" does nothing to disprove the pagan origin of the date and the traditions - that's pretty much impossible, unless you somehow manage to find actual evidence to the contrary. The name itself isn't evidence, it's just a name, likely given in an attempt to christianise Yule, thus making it easier to convert Europeans - it's much easier to convince people to change their religion if the new religion's celebrations are basically the ones they've been observing anyway. So, in closing: Christians, your holiday is about whatever you want it to be about - just be aware that the traditions aren't Christian in origin. However, don't insist on other people observing it the same way as you do. Let people say ""Happy Holidays"" or ""Season's Greetings"", because some of us want to still celebrate the winter solstice in any number of ways (or at least be polite when someone wishes us ""Merry Christmas""). And don't be upset when people put up their own displays that don't show the nativity scene - they're just celebrating their own holiday. Show some tolerance, please.",12

The church needed to assimilate pagan traditions in order to make the transition from pagan to christian smoother. It's a very well known fact and the church does not deny that. Being from scandinavia a lot of the christian holidays are being reverted back to the original meaning, which is a good thing I guess? lol Anywho, the amount of distortion a lot of christians have about their own religion is mind bogling and makes you wonder if they believe anything you tell them, albeit it provides enough incentive for them.",1

It only gained fame because the Roman Emperor Constantine forced it on everyone in his empire. There is much better evidence for the existence of Santa Claus than there is for Jesus existing. By the way, Easter is named for a Sumerian Goddess of fertility and her name was Ishtar and it is pronounced, Easter. The Romans and the Christian church hijacked all the pagan celebrations and give them some Christian bull shit twist. For instance Candlemass, or Groundhogs day is from the Pagan celebration of Imbolc and the Goddess Brigid and the coming of spring and the strengthening of the Sun God who was born at Yule, he is born on the winter solstice every year. Saint Valentines day is from the Roman Pagan practice of Lupercalia, check that one out sometime, it looked bizarre and fun, but not for dogs and goats though. Saint John's day is the summer solstice when the Sun God is at his peak power. Lammas or Loaf Mass is from the Pagan Celtic Lughnassadh, where the Sun God is sacrificed for the beginning of the harvest. He is sacrificed every year and reborn again at yule the Winter Solstice every year. Of course the 23.5 degree tilt of the earth in our orbit around the Sun cause this but it is fun to celebrate the Earth's journey with these celebrations. The point is, Christianity is a huge lie.

She wrapped him in cloths and placed him in a manger, because there was no guest room available for them. 8 And there were shepherds living out in the fields nearby, keeping watch over their flocks at night. 9 An angel of the Lord appeared to them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were terrified. 10 But the angel said to them, “Do not be afraid. I bring you good news that will cause great joy for all the people. 11 Today in the town of David a Savior has been born to you; he is the Messiah, the Lord. 12 This will be a sign to you: You will find a baby wrapped in cloths and lying in a manger.” 13 Suddenly a great company of the heavenly host appeared with the angel, praising God and saying, 14 “Glory to God in the highest heaven, and on earth peace to those on whom his favor rests.” 15 When the angels had left them and gone into heaven, the shepherds said to one another, “Let’s go to Bethlehem and see this thing that has happened, which the Lord has told us about.” 16 So they hurried off and found Mary and Joseph, and the baby, who was lying in the manger. 17 When they had seen him, they spread the word concerning what had been told them about this child, 18 and all who heard it were amazed at what the shepherds said to them. 19 But Mary treasured up all these things and pondered them in her heart. 20 The shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all the things they had heard and seen, which were just as they had been told.",0

The first written account of the ministry of Jesus, the Gospel of Mark, was penned in about 65 to 80 CE, 30 or more years after Jesus was allegedly executed. Importantly, there's not a single contemporary writing from Romans during the time Jesus lived despite the Romans being quite prolific. Not one. Christian apologist websites won't admit this. Wouldn't you think that some Romans would write about a man who claimed to be the son of God, did amazing miracles and then was resurrected? Also note that Jesus didn't correct even one of the many major errors in the bible (Adam and Eve, order of the formation of the universe, the shape, movement and age of the earth, Noah's flood etc.).

There was a reference by the Roman governor of Egypt about Jesus in manuscripts written by monks. The original work however, did not mention Jesus at all. The monks just put it in to keep the story going. They needed some legitimacy, even if it was a lie. There is no record of a Yeshua ben Joseph existing. That is what Jesus would have been called.

Adam could be a gene, or the population of men that had this evolutionary threshold (evolution is still a thing, it's debatable whether it's linear as in darwinism or not, i personally bet that it's not), which made them more sexual. Thus, they outbred the others. In the same sense, buddha and jesus aren't persons, they could be simply metaphors and titles for people who posses a certain ability. Heck, jesus christ wasn't even a name, since christ comes from greek (meaning savior). Maybe there was a revolutionary that was called christ, but looking for evidence about a magical zombie jew would be a waste since that book was written to control simpletons, and as a tool for those that know how to interpret it, not just be spoon fed by the 'true' interpreters child-rapists priests.",0

Beliefs are a matter of conviction (being convinced). What we will and will not believe is due, directly, to what we will accept as justification (e.g. evidence. reason, blind/naive faith, etc) for those beliefs. I am convinced by the overwhelming evidence presented relative to the typical writing style of Josephus, and the lack of flow to the story as to where all the stuff about the Jesus character was thrown in. Had we any surviving original copies of those books, we would have been able to compare handwriting style, and we might even have known if it was actually present in those originals. As it stands, the only surviving copies we have, hold a questionable history. So, even if I could accept the story as reported by Josephus, I'd still have to question the authenticity due to the history of those books, themselves. And, even then, as far as I'm aware, the Josephus account doesn't mention all the miracles. We also have to question the authenticity of any account that has Nazareth as the birthplace of Jesus, since it didn't exist as a settlement of any kind at the time of Jesus. No, there are too many inconsistencies to consider Jesus a real person, or even inspired by a real person. However, there were several people running around at that time claiming to be the prophesied messiah, including John the Baptist. In fact, there is probably more evidence of John the Baptist than of Jesus, who wasn't mentioned by anyone, including Josephus, until decades after his death.",0

And in an other place J. mentions James, who can only have any historical importance as Jesus' brother. You can look this up, for instance, in James H, Chalresworth's The Messiah. I wouldn't exactly call Josephus honorable however. by his own account he was in command of a company of Jewish soldiers during the revolt and got them cornered inside a cave.

So, we have a time frame of roughly (guestimating) about 15 years they could, potentially have become familiar with one another. However, Josephus, by all accounts was not even born till about or at least 4 years after Jesus is supposed to have been crucified. So, He could not possibly have been familiar with Jesus in any way, and would have had difficulty confirming whether or not James was truly the brother of Jesus, even if he knew James personally at some point in time. Also. we should not forget that Jesus, in his sermon on the mount is quoted as having said that all Christians/messianic believing Jews were his brothers and sisters in faith.

Also, reading the Bible, it is easy to see that there are varying accounts that cannot all be true, simultaneously about the same individual, and it's a difficult circle to square. Too many parallels with other deities. If there ever was a historical Jesus he was nothing like the one depicted in the Bible. So, to say there was such a historical figure, and then associate him in any way with the biblical figure, would be stupid, and highly incredible. Prior to these revelations, I had no reason to doubt the existence of a person on whom the biblical narrative may have been built. However, there is precisely nothing to suggest even that much. That is not to say there was never anyone named Jesus, at that time, or prior. On the contrary, the name was quite popular then as it is today. But, I don't see any difference in suggesting that a man named Abraham living today is the basis for the Abraham character in the Bible. In fact, there is little, if anything, in the Bible which can be construed as historically accurate, or even loosely based on historical persons. For instance, the Moses narrative is well known to have been mythological since there is nothing to suggest that Jews were never enslaved in ancient Egypt, and since it matches other Egyptian myths, about the Egyptian people rather than the Hebrews (Israelites). I don't mean a Jesus that was formed by church history either, I mean the historical Jesus. How, pray tell, would you suggest distinguishing between the two? After all, all we can know about this Jesus character, who would have been historical, is by church/canonical dogma. Otherwise, there is no sense in even talking about a historical Jesus. We might as well be talking about the Mexican gardener, Jesus. Who, would have been a real person, though probably not of any historical import.",0

About that, I will say this: Richard Carrier does say that he is not a lone wolf crying in the dark. There are a handful of other scholars who are convinced of the same, or similar, things, openly. And, there are those, he says, who are afraid to admit publicly to their beliefs, for fear of ostracism. He recommends the application of Bayesian theory, because the methodologies used by most others is naturally and inherently flawed. Which does seem to be justified and warranted by the fact that while most scholars may find basic agreement in the historicity of Jesus, they tend to disagree on all but two basic tenets, as mentioned here: ""the only two events subject to ""almost universal assent"" are that Jesus was baptized by John the Baptist and was crucified by the order of the Roman Prefect Pontius Pilate.[11][12][13][14]"" SOURCE: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_Jesus It is also noted within the articles that methodologies are highly contested and hotly debated for reliability. I also find it quite compelling that by applying Bayesian theory he has arrived at the same basic conclusions as D.M. Murdock, who has made an astro-theological connection between most religions from the era and region. His conclusions, though not a one to one match, do fit nicely within that framework, while allowing for other mystic interpretations, making it one of those fascinating multi-layered cakes of intrigues. Not only that, but we can see aspects of what he mentions relative to early Christianity, and several other religions of the region and time still present today across various sects of Christianity. Given all of this, it becomes increasingly difficult to wedge in a historical Jesus. However, I will mention something I'd forgotten to mention earlier, in the interest of honesty and integral inquiry. There are many reports that at the proposed time of Jesus, there were lots of people running around calling themselves the messiah of prophecy, and at least one common theory holds that John the Baptist was just such a character. In fact, it is also believed that John was believed by many of that time and place to have been that messiah, instead of Jesus. So, this would go a long ways toward explaining that exchange during the baptism of Jesus. John bowing to Jesus' authority would have lent a strong credibility to the claim that Jesus was the one true son of God, given the common prior belief that John was he. By that, alone, there would almost be credible reason to believe John was a real person, and Jesus was made up, but lent an air of reality by reports of that exchange.",0

It is hardly surprising that such a figure would have miracle stories attached to him. The existence of a widespread Christian Movement in the late first century, with congregations throughout the eastern Empire and in Rome. Presupposes an earlier movement from which these descend. Within ten years of Jesus' death Paul is involved in persecuting Christians and no doubt new the history of their movement intimately. If he could have attacked them by saying Jesus never existed he surely would have. After his conversion (still within 10 years of Jesus death), he writes letters in which he describes meeting the new leader's of the movement, Jesus's chief disciple (Peter) and his brother (James). What movement would they be the head of how and how did they get into those positions except int he way Paul describes. If Christianity is something created out of whole cloth by Paul, why would Paul invent Peter and James. James is independently attested in Josephus (Jesus probably is too, in a passage which attracted a later interpolation, but Origen and other sources preserve the original reading which mentions both James and Jesus through quotation--I'm no reporting my opinion, but scholarly consensus). Other than in the vase of a few emperors and leading political figures who are mentioned by historians and who left epigraphic evidence, this is a better attestation for the historicity of Jesus than exists for almost any other of the 50 or so million inhabitants of the Roman Empire in the early first century.",0

Oh ye of narrow mind and limited imagination. Religions are highly complex subjects. Far more complex than that which they are proposed to explain. This is what is meant by the term, ""convoluted."" Astro-theology is about religions as a pragmatic narrative that aid in celestial navigation of seasons, and geography, for the purposes of travel and crop management. They also serve to fuel the imagination. Bring those celestial bodies into a human incarnation and you have the makings of a mythological legend of epic proportions. One would, of course, need be versed in linguistics, history, archaeological study, theology, multiple languages, and a couple other subjects to begin to make any real progress in such an inquiry. And, of course, an open and questioning mind is essential. What D.M. Murdock has produced with her large, and well sourced body of work explains a lot about comparative religions, and direct one to one cross-overs (i.e. parallels). Put that together with other works that do not find contradiction, and you have yourself the beginnings of a comprehensive study in theology.

In a review of his two volume set, about the Historicity of Jesus, the first book dedicated to introducing the Bayesian method in language approachable by the average non-academic intellect, and the second dedicated to an analysis of what scant and weak evidence there is for the historicity of Jesus, reviewers, including the author of the article, as well as commenters seem to be in basic agreement... Not with you, but with each other. They felt like the Bayesian method was being degraded by being applied to something as controversial as Jesus studies, immediately upon introducing it as the best method for producing historical accuracy. They all agree that the Bayesian method is the best approach, but that it should have been demonstrated by some historical data which was far less controversial, and, in many way, easier to prove via the Bayesian method. Thus building and gaining confidence in the method before tackling such a controversial and emotive issue. I am drawing this from the article and comment section at the following link: http://lesswrong.com/lw/9pm/minireview_proving_history_bayes_theorem_and_the/ I was in search of reasons not to use Bayes theorem as a methodology for proving history. Instead, what I got was why it shouldn't be used relative to the historical Jesus (yet).

The one at the top of the search results was this one: http://lesswrong.com/lw/774/a_history_of_bayes_theorem/ Which is more of a summary of information contained in another book about Bayes theorem, by a different author. I am now quite confident that Bayes theorem would be extremely useful in analysis of historical data, and even with regard to something as controversial as the historicity of Jesus. Especially since the complaints weren't that it wouldn't work for that, but that doing so early on would tend to raise the ire of a lot of emotional historians who are quite attached to their favorite religious beliefs, causing them to dismiss the theorem as probable...

It's identical. Oral tradition IS a game of telephone, in a very literal sense. Oral tradition is not the same as a game in which people intentionally change a message to make it funny. That's not how the game is played. The game is played, for one, to demonstrate that the message does change from person to person, and in some cases the result can be quite hilarious. Each successive person is supposed to relay the information as reliably and accurately as they can. However, because of the ways in which our brains work, everyone invariably hears, or else places emphasis on different parts, and makes various associations which may or may not be relevant to the information being conveyed. What the Hell did you learn at that college anyhow? Think more in terms of Beowulf, composed in the mid 500s AD; it's still pretty much the same today as it was at its inception. Are you fucking kidding me? Hercules... Ever heard the name? He was a Greek demi-god. His real name was actually Herakles. His stories were passed on by oral tradition, and there are a multitude of variations. The same is true of the Beowulf saga. There are many different tellings and interpretations. Not to mention the fact that in some languages just a slight variation in inflection can change the whole meaning. It's even true in the English language. For instance, ""What the fuck!?!?!?!,"" and ""What the fuck."" Not only that, but given the time frame involved, there is no possible way you could know that the story hadn't changed in drastic ways, building the legend till it was super human in scope and scale. Faith =/= foolishness. I guess it kinda depends on which kind of faith one is talking about. Blind, naive faith is certainly foolish. Faith built on trust earned by experience is not quite as foolish, and sometimes necessary. And, mild blind faith, in facts that are less important is not nearly as foolish as either of the first two. How foolish any form of faith is will depend greatly on the (potential) consequences. That's a huge misconception with Americans these days. I don't know where you're from, but most Americans are devoutly religious, to the point of being absurd in their beliefs. I should know, I live with and among these assholes. Which means that they rely heavily on blind faith, even in matters of life and death importance. So, occasionally, you'll get an American atheist who will overstate the issue of faith being foolish. In all honesty, it isn't always, but the more dire the consequences, the more foolish the faith. People die in traffic accidents, but it takes some level of faith in the general public and in your own driving abilities that that's not going to happen. That is a level of faith based on trust earned by experience. It is neither blind, nor naive faith. Faith in religious dogma is naive when little or no evidence is present, and blind when it runs contrary to evidence. Religious dogma holds dire consequences, no matter ones perspective. Thus, blind and naive faith as applied to religion is ALWAYS foolish. Without faith, you're left to live in your fears. Even with faith one can live in fear. For instance, in my Christian youth, I lived in perpetual fear that demons and monsters may get me while God is attending to some other, more deserving, Christian. I lived in perpetual fear of death, and the consequences of my life... Would I go to Heaven or Hell. I was quite convinced I was headed for Hell, because, despite my best wishes, I could not stop myself from feeling compelled to lie to my parents. That is, till I developed convenient amnesia. I personally have faith that early Christians did not simply have some hidden agenda to create the biggest conspiracy in human history, and there's sufficient evidence to back that belief (stated partially in my previous posts). I, personally, have sufficient reason to believe that all methodologies applied to the historicity of biblical text is fallacious, misleading, and unreliable. The reason I believe this is that it is made quite obvious in the huge disparity among biblical scholars who can only agree on two basic things, it seems...

Telephone is a GAME one plays in elementary school. People don't take it seriously. Oral tradition is part of a person's culture, part of who they are. And as atheists so obnoxiously point out, culture is something people start wars over. Unfounded faith in any aspect IS foolish - the Bible even says to ""not test the Lord your God,"" and illustrates the meaning by Satan suggesting that Jesus jump off a cliff. It means, ""don't do something you know is stupid and expect God to save you."" Faith, however, is when you don't have every answer, but you have a good idea of something, and act as if it were true. Foolishness is acting a certain way against the evidence. Day-to-day life requires some level of faith (in various forms). Period. Agree with me or not, if you disagree, you're wrong. Period. End of discussion. America has become progressively more atheist. In the past 10 years, you see the media saying more and more about religious extremism by Islam and the Westboro Baptist Church, but it's frowned upon when anyone mentions Jesus as a source of strength or inspiration. Eyes roll and reporters smile condescendingly. As for the consistency in Mark, Matthew, and Luke, all I can say is, read them - there are many more similarities than differences. One thing Bible critics do is point out what they claim to be contradictions in the Bible between things which are not mutually exclusive. For example, if I said that, during my summer vacation, I went to the beach and I later tell someone else that on my summer vacation, I climbed a mountain, I didn't lie; I could have gone to Hawaii for my summer vacation, and done both of those things! In the Bible, people will point to what Jesus said on the cross, and claim it's contradictory....He was up on the cross for hours there, people. He died a slow, agonizing death. Is it really that crazy to think that he said a bunch of things on that cross? If you use your motherfucking head, placed between your motherfucking shoulders, it's really not that complicated. Besides, the sole purpose of the Nicene Councils was to eliminate heretical (untrue) books that began to pop up about Jesus, because early Christians understood the importance of ensuring the integrity of the works. People didn't travel hundreds or thousands of miles to meet somewhere just because they felt like it, because they thought it would be fun, or whatever. They did it because they thought that humanity had just witnessed one of the most important events in its history, and they wanted to paint the most accurate and complete portrait of Jesus without including anything that didn't really happen (the Gnostic Christians, among others, had begun to warp who Jesus was). So, do I trust the dozens of church members committed to the cause of preserving the memory of Jesus Christ, or do I trust the minority of doubters 2,000 years removed from the events in question? I'll take the former. That's where my faith comes in. As evolution would tell us, people are still the same old chimps we were 2,000 years ago - we just have different tools.

An action that can only be driven by the primary foolish act of unfounded faith in belief. And as atheists so obnoxiously point out, culture is something people start wars over. Yeah, I'll admit that atheists are obnoxiously right about that one. Let us not forget that religion or else the lack of it, is a pivotal aspect of most cultures. The ones that start wars most often? The most religious ones, of course. And the ones who most often abstain from active warfare? The most atheistic ones. We are obnoxious about pointing that one out too. Unfortunately for your position we are also obnoxiously right about it. Day-to-day life requires some level of faith (in various forms). Period. Agree with me or not, if you disagree, you're wrong. Period. End of discussion. Meh, Okay.",0

(Love and jealousy go together. Envy, is about hate. ""She got the promotion - me so envious"" versus, ""She's leaving - broken heart - jealous for her""). Not everybody knows this. Now, God is in Christ, and it is written, ""all the fulness of the godhead dwells in him bodily"". Wherefore, the safe way to call upon the name of the Lord is to acknowledge the Son. It is written that God has made his son Jesus both Lord and Christ. Christ is the Word made flesh. Jesus Christ is Lord. See, Exodus 23 :20-22 ; Matthew 7 :24-27, kjv... ""Upon A rock"", as opposed to ""upon THE sand"" - wherefore, seek a specific rock. This, Saving Christmas, is an interesting looking movie. Curious to see (hear) his argument to reconcile the commercial aspects of Christmas with theological truths. I suppose one could see Santa as a cautionary tale. What happens when a man is no longer useful, able to make things in a workshop? Will magic elves help him keep deadlines? Will he work for food - milk and cookies even? (Art is open to subjective interpretation : I still see ""the Samta meme"" as propaganda promoting what Noam Chomsky has called, ""an irrational attitude of submission towards authority"".) Usury, (""using"" others - looking upon them as a ""resource"") is bad. Making the elderly feel valued, is good. Umm, some though might argue that being used is a great feeling - to be Superman, rather than Clark. Santa, as superhero? Umm, he's more like a bartender. The Christmas Tree. What fruit does it bare? The money tree - Do not confuse the love OF money, with the love FOR money. ""What can I get with this nickel?"" versus, ""I need another dollar to legally obtain.."" How well do you know a loved one? ""Wow, power tools, because I'm a dad, right? Question - have you ever seen me fix anything? Do I look like Jennie Garth?"" Well, it is the feeling, rather than the thinking, that counts, right? A tree, perchance, a Cross. It is written, Cursed is he who hangs on a tree. But what does that mean, to ""hang on"" a tree? Idolatry? If you focus, stare at a tree, are you ""hanging"" on it? 3d vision? Should you see the forest rather, as if looking at a 2d painting? Men, how like trees, moving about? Women, how like birds, looking for a branch, a place of rest? Moses, once made a brass serpent, and hung it about a pole, and lifted it up- like a string of popcorn around a tree, reaching up towards a focal point, a star.. The law of Moses, like the flesh, is passing, but the spirit remains, does it not? : Focus not on things which are temporal, but upon things which are eternal. See, Philippians 4:8, kjv. The Christmas Tree - art is open to subjective interpretation. Water is considered a necessity, and is associated with sobriety. In contrast, wine is considered a luxury, and is associated with drunkeness. Art, music, rituals, dances, how like wine? Meditating upon holy writ, how like water - necessary?: Very. To put Christ first, desire sobriety. Advice : Ignore ""holidays"": Should not, for Believers, every day, be a holy day? Every year, there are days, and seasons wherein drunkeness is encouraged. Well, I suppose there is a time to plant, and a time to harvest, to celebrate.. Footloose (Kevin Bacon)? But I think oft upon how many feel oppressed, and not liberated, wherefore celebration ""seemeth wickedness"" to me - ""bah hum bug"", I suppose, you will hear. A Christmas Carol, by Charles Dickens, the book and the movie (pick one), how like propaganda? : If you buy others turkey dinners, they will like you - No, they will think you are running for public office. Stay in ""logic-space"", and be ye not, ""emotionally compromised"" : Stay Real. This movie should do well in dvd sales. I still like, The Greatest Story Ever Told, though I do not watch it now that I study the Bible, for it seems not wise to mix water with wine. Holiday Wishes, starring Amber Benson, is pretty good. It's A Wonderful Life - disturbing, because of the noticeable absence of ""the black man"" : ""Missuh Bailey, when I heards about your money woes, I cames a running. I know if I lost white folks' money, they'd be getting them some rope. Now I don't have much, but what I gots, is yours - let's see, two buttons, a spool of thread, and a dime""... Now, now, get out of here, you clown.. that's not going to cover the deposit.. Oh wait, I better take the dime.. Always remember the sufferings of Job, and how his friends berated him for not admitting fault, when they could have given him a present instead, with fancy giftwrap, to cheer him up.

""You were always a Jew - temporary amnesia"".. See, Judges 11 : 23-24, kjv. If the LORD decides to destroy a people, ""the inhabitants of the land"", He will. (Sodom and Gomorah come to mind. Was Lot an inhabitant of Sodom, or did he merely dwell there? What makes one an inhabitant, as opposed to a stranger?) He has not given Israel, to my knowledge, a ""standing order"", from generation unto generation to ""hunt down"" and destroy ""the wicked"", and pursue an expansionary ""land grab"" policy. Yet, land and people are oft mentioned together, as if land is important. It does make sense to say that the earth has been given to the godly to possess it, though the wicked ""control"" the land, by means of guns, requiring taxes (tribute) to be paid. Why does the LORD permit the wicked to prosper, for the innocent to be persecuted. The story of Job, is never far from my mind. I guess life is a test, and the test is, Do you yet believe in love, though what happens in life would have you believe otherwise? The TV show, Dome, comes to mind. Is that not a similitude of Israel? - shut off from the world, and charged with the task of creating a perfect society, free of usury (looking upon others as a resource - to use them), until such time ""the egg"" might hatch, and the Dome, come down? Christians believe that the egg has hatched. Which makes it perplexing that soo many who call themselves Christian, should advocate, Policy Z? What good can come of it? Or is Judeo-Palestine not in conflict with the Law of Moses? They who walk after the flesh, are under the Law. Whereas they who walk after the Spirit are under Grace. For example, if you regard food as medicine (the flesh is weak, though the spirit is willing), then kosher dietary laws do not apply. Or would an Orthodox Jew refuse a tylenol capsule, if it was coated in gelatin? The land of Canaan. Labels help justify murder, theft of property, etc. And so many preachers, and pastors, liken men to dirt, dung even, rather than to trees. They claim, ""black men"" are ""canaanites"", and ""canaanites"" are to be used as slaves, or destroyed. And their land taken. This explains acts of evil such as ""Wounded Knee"" - so-called, because ostensibly they would have you care more for a soldier who falls off of his horse, than for the persons who were murdered there. Blacks, Indians, Arabs, Mexicans - they do not call such Christians, for that might make it difficult to kill them, enslave them, or steal from them. Noah did NOT curse Canaan, but said yhat Canaan was cursED. Nor did he say that the brothers of Canaan were cursed. It seems obvious then that his brothers were as their father Ham - wicked. Wherefore as a social worker might, Noah removed Canaan from the household of Ham, and said he would be a servant of Shem, and also of Japheth, (and servant does NOT mean slave - a slave is as a tool, unable to disobey). Jesus said that a servant does not remain in the house forever, but the son abides forever. Noah gave Canaan a hope of adoption, while distancing him from the household of Ham - his brothers would not be able to distinguish Canaan from other servants. Of, means, from, or, belonging to. A rabbit of rabbits, is what a magician might pull out of a hat - one of many. But now they who wish to promote slavery, eugenics, etc., preach a different gospel - perverting the words of the Living God to create their ""social utopia"", paving the way for antichrist.

You have to begin somewhere. On the other hand, there is a darkness to ""christmas"" - rearrange the letters, SANTA, to get SATAN... Is that not mind-control technology?

The early Catholic church just followed the formula of adopting the holidays and changing the gods. Half the early Saints in Catholicism were just gods turned into people. Pagan religious sites had churches plopped on top of them for the same reason. The only sheep I see here is the one who thinks one book holds all the answers.

She wrapped him in cloths and placed him in a manger, because there was no guest room available for them. 8 And there were shepherds living out in the fields nearby, keeping watch over their flocks at night. 9 An angel of the Lord appeared to them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were terrified. 10 But the angel said to them, “Do not be afraid. I bring you good news that will cause great joy for all the people. 11 Today in the town of David a Savior has been born to you; he is the Messiah, the Lord. 12 This will be a sign to you: You will find a baby wrapped in cloths and lying in a manger.” 13 Suddenly a great company of the heavenly host appeared with the angel, praising God and saying, 14 “Glory to God in the highest heaven, and on earth peace to those on whom his favor rests.” 15 When the angels had left them and gone into heaven, the shepherds said to one another, “Let’s go to Bethlehem and see this thing that has happened, which the Lord has told us about.” 16 So they hurried off and found Mary and Joseph, and the baby, who was lying in the manger. 17 When they had seen him, they spread the word concerning what had been told them about this child, 18 and all who heard it were amazed at what the shepherds said to them. 19 But Mary treasured up all these things and pondered them in her heart. 20 The shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all the things they had heard and seen, which were just as they had been told.",0

While yes many large religions are offshoot tales based on Jesus, Jesus is the only one of all dieties to actually prove His existence and perform actual miracles. An example of and offshoot is Islam. They believe that Jesus' Father (God) sent Mohammed who is the Comforter in their minds. They quote the Bible for this. Jesus said He was going to leave so His Father can send the Comforter, which is actually the Holy Ghost. They do two things, commit the unforgivable sin of blaspheming the Holy Ghost by saying it is not the Comforter and they also confirm that Jesus is God/the Son of God.

The ""god"" or ""gods"" (Depending on the texts you interpret, the old testament was polytheistic) from the christian bible is so schizoid, megalomaniacal and insane that I realized the bible was bullshit by about age eight from reading it. ""He"" does things so randomly, abruptly and without meaning that you'd think that people 2,000 years ago were just making things up off the top of their heads. Oh wait.Not to mention most of the myths in the bible are from other texts from that era. Christians are among the most pathetic religious people because they don't even study their own religion, they go based on random preachers' interpretations of it, which are about as accurate as the original interpretations as they're complete bullshit and whatever the preacher is feeling at the time. If God created science, the bible could explain a single thing in modern science. The bible couldn't even get the anatomical number of ribs from a man right (If Eve was made from Adam's rib, shouldn't men have one less rib?) The bible doesn't explain anything in math, science or logic, it doesn't comprehend the notion of evolutionary biology and every single facet of it that shapes our modern understanding of medicine (The medicine you probably use or would use if you were dying instead of prayer) The bible was written from iron age peasants' interpretation of things they believed were true. It still confounds and amazes me that religious people will ignore obvious truth, i.e. actual self evident truth in order to hold onto a lie that comforts them. Because when you step back and look at the big picture the lie is less comforting and more disturbing. Especially because religion is probably the true source of injustice in the world.",8

An example (these numbers are random as I do not remember the exact details at the moment): A purchase was made and he paid for a house for 23 gold. Later when talking about this same event the Bible says he paid 50 gold for the whole property. CONTRADICTION! No, the first is how much he bought the house for, the second is how much he bought the property for. I'm pretty sure this ""contradiction"" is in Daniel. The Bible isn't full of crap, nor is it based on other mythologies. When the Nephalim fell from Heaven, who knows what evil they brought upon the earth before the flood that was told in stories long after. I think there were a group of giants or something that were self-proclaimed ""gods"" before the flood and they survived in tale from the stories told by the descendants of Noah. Men of incredible strength lived back then, like Goliath and Samson. So it is easily possible of thinking there was a man named Hercules running around performing incredible feats.

In recent years, Passion of the Christ was very powerful (and also a blockbuster). More recently: The Bible (History Channel series) was excellently done, where Son of God was brought to the theater (taken from The Bible). Both were hits. The latest two hits were God is Not Dead and Heaven is for Real. They were both done very well. Kirk Cameron, unfortunately, produces very cheesy films. I've watched a couple of them and they're actually pretty embarrassing. After getting through them, you want to say ""that wasn't so bad,"" but you end up saying ""why the hell do they make these things so damn cheesy?"" Whoever produced God is Not Dead and Heaven is for Real, however, were on the right track. Less cheese, less in your face messaging - just a good wholesome movie about the impact of Christianity.

But most christians will not take the effort to learn the difference in dates. You'll need to learn about the Hebraic Festival dates and especially the significance of these dates.

This had to be because the shepherds saw Him during the Feast of Tabernacles ""Sukkhot"" occuring this year from October 9th - 16th. Also known as the Festival of Booths. This is when Jews will make a temporary shelter and live in it that has a roof that is open under the sky. Since most christians have no idea what these festivals mean, why they are celebrated, and when they occur, it's highly understandable why the settle for December 25th.

Second, If the Bible is a historical account, archeology and independent historical records would verify much of it. But there isn't one single Biblical event that has been verified. Not one. Yet quite a bit of the record disproves it. A huge portion of the validity of the Old Testament rests on the Hebrews being a slave race in Egypt. The Egyptians were extensive record keepers. They were equal opportunity enslavers. The Hebrews just lived there. The pyramids were built by paid labor. The worker villages have been excavated and it was pretty clear they lived a middle class lifestyle. The best scientific evidence against the historical accuracy of the bible? Irrefutable DNA evidence that there were NEVER only two humans alive at any point in time. And likewise, there is zero support for a simultaneous genetic bottleneck of all animal species, including humans, about 4,000 years ago due to being restricted to a single wooden boat. Israeli archaeologists uncovered the 8,000-year-old remains of a prehistoric structure nestled away in the upscale neighborhood of Ramat Aviv. The cornerstone of the ancient building, which lies on a construction site for exclusive apartments, long precedes the time of Abraham and the rest of the Bible’s figures. This 8,000-year-old discovery shows that there were humans in Israel two thousand years before the world was created, according to many Bible literalists! And this find is not alone in its antiquity: The city of Jericho’s foundation is millennia older, and very ancient remains of human culture dating tens of thousands of years ago have also been found in Israel. By comparison, the Bible and its portrayals constitute much later human artifacts and innovations.",2

The biblical Jesus never existed outside the bible. A man named Jesus might have lived at that time in that area, but he's not the one being mentioned in the bible. There are no other recordings about Jesus until 200 years after he suposedly lived. Back then they weren't very good at recording history like we can today, so the only logical assumption to make is that Jesus is a myth along side Hercules, Zeus, Thor, Odin, Vishnu, Kali, Ra, Osiris (being the first incarnation of Jesus according to history and documents) etc. It is easy to dismis all of this because it doesn't fit into your personalized little univers, but facts are facts and faith is the same as fiction. If we started to value faith above facts, you would have to take my word for it, have faith in me when I said that I was the king of Scotland. Like I said, Faith dictates it.

It's funny you write; ""I won't listen to arrogant people arguing against scriptures they haven't even read."" yet your monotheistic viewpoint does exactly that when you're deeming all other religions to be false.

He wants you to choose Him, but He loves you enough to let you decide! that is why so many people have an issue and feel the need to be so..... how can I put it..... bilergerant, when they try to prove their point of how strongly they do not believe.
