This trailer is mismarketed and so is this film. It is NOT a 'gothic romance' and it is NOT a 'horror' or a 'thriller'. It just dances back and forth between elements of the three as if you had written all three complete stories in mind and just wound up making aesthetics, NOT the house itself, a key player. You don't even introduce us to the grounds in an ominous enough way or pull out great performances, either. You talked about this being an empowering film for women and it is the opposite of that. There are no clear villains or victims and while that worked in a film like The Devil's Backbone and The Golden Army, it does not work here. We want Hiddleston to be an all-out monster or a hero, not rape-bully and the same is true for the rest of this powerful cast; you got Alice, Loki, and a Jaeger Pilot and used them to form the flimsiest love triangle since The . . . so that was YOU that did that in The Hobbit! The metaphor between butterflies and moths is not nearly as dark as you think, either. It actually seems silly in this setting. While I think this has a place in film like 'Sleepy Hollow' was a Tim Burton film strictly this could be seen as strictly a Del Toro style of film; but are bloodlust for land from our protagonists (that's right, industrialists were just that, not heroic and selfless in the majority of their cases Carnegie was a once in a lifetime guy) and constant undertones of incest that have been building in your films really what you want the world to associate with you? I would've written the ending to show at least a photograph of Edith's mother courting Thomas to hint at either immortality through keeping the house and the two are desperate for that reason as well as isolated, or to find out that Edith's mother is cousin to the Sharpe family and that gives her a bloodlink that allows her to remove that dishonor from the family name. And why wasn't the ghost of her father looking out for her as well? Do you not believe in male ghosts for their own sake, just women's? If Edith could just 'see ghosts' and was not simply intuitive the way an unexplained Stephen King child gets telepathy, then why was she not 'seeing dead people' much, much more unless she could pinpoint her father telling her to ignore them or something? You had an interesting idea, but like so many people in art galleries you only got in a few pieces and didn't take in the depth of the whole exhibit. I think what Stephen King really found scary about your film was its budget, not the story. It's The Fall of the House with The Seven Flowers in the Attic. If you read, you'll be able to see how many disappointing ripoffs were given such a superficial picture. Some people might find this amusing, but I don't think you're sure of the group of messages that will be taken from it and that's not what an artist's approach to expression is.",0,false,0,,,,,,

In the trailer Edith said if they were caught she would be ""locked up"" and he would be ""hanged."" That makes them human! And, Edith tells her brother that he cannot leave her with tears in her eyes and he seemed agitated. I think Edith is a serial killer from a line of them and her brother brings her victims. Perfect setting in a old house that has privacy to do ""whatever"" without anyone questioning them. So, the people she has murdered are now ghosts. It also appears that the older gentlemen at the dance is a victim. His son is probably in love with the wife and will at some point save her. Although the ghosts appear malevolent, some will attempt to tell her and save her. I also think the complication/romance is going to be the brother is going to fall in love with his wife.

You can see Wonderland in the beginning as a terrible place, full of disaster, and in the ending it's like a peaceful fungi forest. Wonderland now seems like a much better place. If you look at some of the last word Cheshire Cat says ‚ÄùForgetting pain is convenient. Remembering it, agonizing. But recovering the truth is worth the suffering. And our Wonderland, though damaged, is safe in memory‚Ä¶ for now.‚Äù. Here Wonderland is Alice's mind, She was ignorant, but somewhat happy (convenient, right?). After she discovered the truth, hell broke loose. It was a time full of disaster (agonizing?). But she pulled through, and overcame her enemy, the therapist (worth the suffering?), and is now safe (Wonderland, though damaged, is safe in memory). In short I think it symbolizes how she overcame her ignorance and pulled through, and is now enlightened and stronger. If you've seen ""Alice: Otherlands (I think it's called)"", you can see that Alice has concurred her own mind, and now enters the minds of others. Through her ""torture"" she's come through victoriously, strong enough enter the minds of others (it can be a symbol though). In the Alice: Otherlands, she says she was afraid of fire (her family?), but isn't anymore. She's overcome her own fear, and is stronger than ever. Sorry for the long reply, but I think it's REALLY interesting! I could go on several hundred lines more, but let's stop here XD",0

This movie consists of both killing and ghosts. There's her mother's ghost and the other people's ghosts that were killed inside that mansion by Thomas (Tom) and her 'sister' but it was really his wife. But there's not a lot of jumpscares so it's good. But this is really violent because they show blood and how they kill each other. It's really violent I can't even. Where Thomas wife killed her father is the worst scene ever I mean they smashed his head onto the sink until it broke and until his head is like smashed and showed all of it omg,0

Especially the closed in staircase at 0:15 and the long hallway at 0:17 (though the wall decor has some spikes added here) His name is even quoted in one of the comments for 'this' movie. I wonder if they used parts of that same house? I know the Rose Red house was an old manor that had been turned into separate apartments and then used for the mini-series, while parts of the Rose Red house were set pieces. I'd be very curious to know where Crimson Peak was filmed. In any case, this looks like an actually well done horror movie. I've never been a fan of torture-porn horror, I'd much rather see a creepy good old fashion ghost/monster story, if it's well written of course.

He's very stylized and has a very distinct stamp that he leaves on all of his movies. Some have not been up to par, but for the most part they've all been wonderful. I did find this trailer a bit underwhelming. I've heard much buzz surrounding Crimson Peak and was interested to see the trailer, but I wasn't feeling it. I do think much of it has to do with Mia Wasikowska. I've never been a fan of her's and I tend to lean toward the feeling that she drags down any film that she's in. She usually plays the same character and she doesn't add much life to any scene she's in, and while I hate to base my opinion of her character off a 2 1/2 minute trailer, it does seem like her typical thing. I really wanted to like this trailer. I just didn't. I perked up when I saw Tom Hiddleston but I just couldn't get passed my complete indifference to Wasikowska. I'd rather love her or hate her, but I just don't even care about her which is bad to me. She's like the female Brecken Meyer. They could both disappear and I just wouldn't care. Might go see it when it comes out. Man I really wanted to love this trailer!",1,true,4,,,,,,

But just because you get work doesn't mean that you're talented. Kristen Stewart starred in a franchise and it's pretty much a universal agreement that she's awful. Same with Jai Courtney. I don't know how that guy keeps getting work. Mia could be really good, but I've yet to see her deliver a performance that made me leave the theater feeling that she blew me away. That's why I'm indifferent towards her. At the same time, she's 25 years old and all those actors and actresses are established people and they're not going to say anything bad about her. What the say is what they're expected to say. Again, I don't hate her. I don't love her either. I just don't care about her. Maybe she'll surprise me in this one. I would love it if she did.",0

Mia blew me away the first time I saw her years ago as Sophie on ""In Treatment"" - I immediately called up a friend to tell him about this new brilliant actress. When Meryl Streep accepted her Golden Globe, out of nowhere she brought up Mia's performance in ""Jane Eyre"" calling it ""fantastic"" (Mia wasn't there, and she hadn't been nominated - Meryl just wanted to sing her praises) this was NOT what she was expected to say. It's fine if you don't connect to Mia, but please realize there are many viewers, actors, and directors who do - she just doesn't happen to broadcast on your frequency, so you're not getting the message. That's fine, not everyone will. I'm incredibly excited about seeing Crimson Peak, for Del Toro, for Tom Hiddelston, and most especially, for Mia Wasikowska.",2

I think Mia is extremely talented. I've seen five of her films and non of them were the same performance or character type. She's actually quite a versatile actress. Del Toro likened working with her to driving a Porche cause he could ask her to do different approaches and was totally happy with all the results. I like that she's not an over-acting, perky Hollywood actress. She is a very authentic actress with a nuanced intensity and emotion in her. Edward Zwick said, ""her inner life is so vivid that it comes across even when she's being still."" It seems that most that don't like her saw her in Alice In Wonderland. I didn't see Alice because it looked too froced and contrived. That includes Johnny Depp, Mia and the whole look of it. Maybe she wasn't a good fit, and it has left folks always seeing her as her Alice performance. Although some said she wasn't that bad. She got Alice at 19 and was considered an impressive, young artist out of Australia. She has mostly done quality indie films since or bigger serious films like Defiance and usually partnered with brilliant actors and directors (ie. Michael Fassbender, Edward Zwick ..). Crimson is her return to the big fantasy block buster, and she looks like she hitting the mark to me.",0

I don't get this stupid mindset that any use of CGI at all will automatically make a film ""worse"" or something and that practical effects are /always/ better.

You'd think by 1980 every writer would know that filmmakers take your book and need to turn it into THEIR film. Hemingway had that figured out in 1932! You can't do a five hour audio book just to make the writer happy. When King got around to doing ""The Shining"" the way he wanted to, it was over six hours long. I guess if Kubrick had made a six-hour-long film in 1980, King would've been happier! The thing is, even King messed around with the book. His version adds a sappy ""10 years later"" scene where the ghost of Jack looks on proudly as his little boy, Danny, graduates from High school. Aww, how sweet! It's sorta like Obi-Wan Kenobi - but stupid. Now, if Kubrick had tacked that on, King would've trashed the film. Oh, wait - that's what he did, anyway. Here's a funny side note: the Kubrick estate owned partial approval rights to any subsequent remakes of ""The Shining."" So, King had to get permission - from Kubrick! - to make his six hour epic. Here's the punchline: Kubrick said it was no problem - as long as King stopped trashing Kubrick's version. Now, THAT'S funny . . .! :)",1

When I saw the film, it became clear Kubrick was making changes. Funny thing is - or maybe that was the point - because he wasn't following the novel page by page, I got scared because I didn't know what was coming next. If he had done a perfect adaptation, I would've sat there think, ""Yeah. That was the way it was in the book. That, too. And that. Yawn"" It's like Kubrick set out to make sure you freaked out by taking away all the fussy details of the novel you're expecting to see - and focusing on three people in a creepy, isolated place going nuts. I didn't miss the topiary hedge. I didn't miss the ongoing subplot of the boiler which had to be taken care of. I didn't miss Danny's three million conversations with ""Tony."" And I'm sure King wasn't angry about sales of his novel shooting up because Kubrick picked it up and thought, ""You know, this would make a great film."" They both rewrote the ending. Kubrick's ending is a brilliant WTF moment. King's finale is ""Full House"" style group hug - with a friendly ghost looking on! One thing's for sure: the stick up King's bum over Kubrick's film seems to be permanent. Despite some REALLY crappy adaptations of his writing, it's ""The Shining"" he won't stop bitching about. I'm sure his tombstone will read ""Here lies Stephen King - The Master of Modern Horror Writers. He was born September 21st, 1947 and Stanley Kubrick really ruined ""The Shining.""
