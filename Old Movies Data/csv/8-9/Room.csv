For me its a film about coming out of captivity and how people react to something they cannot relate to. It had smacks of true crime cases such as the 'Ariel Castro' case and the 3 girls held in his house and a child born to him within the 10 years, and also the 'Josef Fritzl' case who abducted his own daughter for 24 years by design and incestuously abused her resulting in her having... 7 children to her own father. The themes of 'Room' touches on so many ie the bond between mother and son and its strength, how the child does not know that there is a real world outside of the 4 walls and has never felt rain or sun on his skin, sexual abuse and molestation, reuniting 'with world', fitting in, heroism, courage, the media, the family unit, isolation, depression, resources, imagination, the power of play, the power of language, what freedom means, perception, relationships, the police and how they handle or don't handle these kind of crimes, the recovery process and many more..Powerful film that will stay with you long after you have left the 'room'.",0,false,0,,,,,,

Can anyone tell me, about how much of the movie is spent in ""the room"" and how much is spent after their escape? Because the trailer seems to imply that the majority of the movie is devoted to their escape, recovery, and healing. If so, I find that particularly impressive. Typically, your ""abduction by bad guy"" plot line shows capture, lingers over abuse, and only shows escape as the final scene. Issues such as recovery, healing, and lasting trauma from the abuse are often ignored because they don't fit into the sort of simplistic tension-climax-resolution dramatic arc moviemakers are used to. But by centralizing the abuser I think such stories give abusers more power and attention than they deserve. There ought to be more movies where the abuser is not centralized but rather the story is about the victims and how they rebuild their lives and become survivors afterwards. That's where the real story is.",0,false,0,,,,,,

You go through the concern of whether or not they will ever escape, the terror of what might happen to Jack during the attempt, Jack's fear when he doesn't know whether or not Old Nick killed his mother, and then finally the movie's larger question of how both mother and son will be able to handle the world. If you go into the movie knowing nothing about the book but having watched the trailer, those first three questions have already been answered for you. Yes, there are some great emotional scenes in the first half, but plot-wise, it's a countdown until the escape. For the viewer who knows escape is coming, the stakes can't possibly feel as high in that first half. It doesn't mean that someone who watched the trailer first can't enjoy the movie. It just means that there is a more satisfying ride in store for those who haven't.",3

When you want to watch a movie at the cinema you want to watch entertainment, comedy, fun, a meaningful story. Not misery like this. There is already too much of misery in 24hr news, in real life. Misery is different from sadness. This trailer tells me this movie is bleak. And bleakness is also different from sadness. Charlie Chaplin produced sadness in his short films: but they hinted at hope, at life. Misery and bleakness are dispiriting. This movie is complete fiction: so why make it bleak, miserable? This movie is just self-indulgent nonsense - the fact that this type of movie is made is a reflection of our self-regarding, conceited world. Don't be dragged down by it. Don't go and watch it. Could you really watch it twice? Really? (I've only watched the trailer - and the movie does not appeal to me).",2

And an enterprise it is these days where evil, wrongdoing, scandal in a sensationalist, media-driven world are all seemingly immediately up for the highest bidder to buy the film or book rights into, via perhaps some so-called other work of art (that might reference an actual event), or actual real-life experience. This kind of reactive cultural enterprising has the effect of trivialising the immorality, the iniquities (where they exist) that are sought to be portrayed. It's like saying, 'Thank you Mr. Bad Guy for being in the right place, at the right time - without you it would not have been possible for our enterprise to win awards and a tidy sum of money.' And the bigger picture of society's malaise is lost - society thus cannot see the wood for the trees. Would an ethnic minority enterprise make a movie with this type of storyline if searching to make a meaningful story? I think it would concentrate on what's important to society, its society. But its society is the majority's, too. We need to make movies that ALL in a society can relate to (not just for self-pitying, white, western middle class). That's why I said this type of movie is made, this Room movie, due to the streak of self-indulgent nonsense (that is a feature of our money-focussed society). And the one-word title is dire: probably so titled because a quick four-letter tap online can access all the 'wonderful' stuff we need to know about it. Take '12 Angry Men': a great movie, with no ethnic minority representation (the original): but one ALL in society can relate to. But UPLIFTING too! There is hope for ALL!",1

I assumed you were talking about Josef Fritzl's daughter, Elizabeth. That's why I wanted to note the number of children Elizabeth really had (including the child he murdered by refusing to get that child medical care--as it was so incredibly important to Elizabeth, that that horrific act be recognized as the murder that it was, and her child be recognized as one of the children that had lived). If you were referring to something else, I must've misunderstood, so I apologize for my end of the blunder =) But, I do think you didn't make it quite clear that you were no longer talking about Elizabeth Fritzl. Anyhoo, I absolutely agree that the horrific trauma she endured, in the years of rapes before he imprisoned her, and then for all of those years in captivity, with so little space and air, and absolutely no sunlight--is ABSOLUTELY UNIMAGINABLE, as you point out.

BUT, thankfully, the upstairs children and downstairs children apparently have finally bonded as siblings and Elizabeth as their mom, and are close. At first the kids were at odds with one another. They now all live together, still in a sort of hiding. The media is awful, so that's made their healing process far more difficult.

Other than that, the popcorn munching and paper crackling and coughing in the theater audience is .... ummmm .... annoying / distracting. The soundtrack is rather quiet at times.
