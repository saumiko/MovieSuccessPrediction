Just because you make one a sparkly vampire and one a cgi wolf does't give it a plot. Oh I guess I forgot about all of the talking about feelings, face-touching, lip-biting, and eye-rolling. That's definitely worth the 8 bucks and 120 minutes of your time that you'll never get back. Also, 7 minutes of blurry ""vampire-running"" is not an action scene.",0,false,0,,,,,,
