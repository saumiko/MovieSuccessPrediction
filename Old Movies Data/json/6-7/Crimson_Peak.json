It was insanely beautiful and yet horrid all at the same time. Each and every actor brought a wonderful performance to the table. I have seen quite a few people saying that this movie is bad and too slow for them?!?!! This movie was wonderful. I was never bored while watching! The cinematography was very pleasing visually. Gothic Romance/ horror is a very slim genre and this film definitely delivered! ^_^",

I know it's a period piece and incest adds drama, but as someone who had dealt with abuse from siblings, it was just a little too much. I know things are going to be triggering, but I absolutely love horror. Especially period horror. And I love Tom Hiddleston. I guess one hing that bothers me is the support that Thomas and Lucille get as a couple. Okay, rant over.",

Not a film for jumpscare horror geeks - more creepy, atmospheric, romantic and tragic with some blood and gore, but NOT the main focus. It's not about ghosts, but ghosts are in it - as Edith says, they're metaphors.",

Then the love component of the story increases the conflict between the characters and actually leaves the viewers questioning whether they love or hate the one character (Thomas), which then determines if the viewer is devistated or releived by the end of the film.",

It's more about the two different types of love that exists in this movie. That's why it's not a horror movie or a scary movie. But in the trailer it looks like it's only a ghost story. There's no love story in it. But that's basically what the whole movie is about. Yeah.. whatever. It's an amazing movie and I absolutely recommend it.",

They are calling each other by their last names when he proposes. Then her father is suddenly and obviously murdered. Who accidently slips, falls and cracks their head numerous times? Next thing the socialite daughter is whisked off to the decaying mauseleum of a home belonging to the mysterious stranger and his sister. The place is falling down around her. Is she not the least bit suspicious of her new husband's motives. He is obviously not well off despite having a title while he is about to come into a fortune left by her father. Need I go on.",

Strangely predictable it is festooned with cheesy CGI ghosts and great silvery moths that flutter through the great masoleum of a house (get out the moth balls!). While you cannot fault the actors (they are excellent) even their thespian talents are incapable of salvaging a hopelessly muddled script. If only Del Toro had brought in a Stephen King or a Tom Clancey type for re-writes. Oh well.",

Btw the movie had a last boss battle. lol. The whole concept was artistically beautiful with every ghost having an awesome design while the house and their clothing was awesome too.

This is a throwback movie and love letter to classic gothic horror like the films of Mario Bava, Dario Argento, Hammer horror films, the old dark house subgenre, and classic gothic literature like Edgar Allan Poe plus many other inspirations. Like most of Del Toro's work, the true horror of the story is not supernatural, but people themselves. As a fan of the classics, this movie was amazing!",

Movies are made to be enjoyed. Just enjoy this one. At most it is a masterpiece and at least it is a solid horror movie.",

If you're looking for a horror movie though, this might not be for you since it delves more into (very) creepy/mystery rather than horror.

It's worth a viewing in the theaters for sure, as the movie's truly meant to be seen on the big screen. Just go for the $6 Tuesday movie ticket when you can. (Serously, why do people insist on paying $10+ for a movie nowadays?)",

The trailer is showing just the scary parts with some dramatic horror music, so the ones who see it are expecting a solid horror movie. After all it's just some gothic romance for little girls. And that is dissapointing indeed. At least it was for me and I can see I'm definitely not the only one..",

Sure, it has some jump scares, but this is no reason to blame on the movie. You cheated on yourself. You got the trailer to take the best of your expectations. Judging a movie should be based on the movie itself, and what it presents to the audience. I saw beauty, gothic sets, love, the good and bad that comes with love. Advertising should not be the basis of whether you enjoy a movie or not. Clearly, you are inspired by the culture that comes with Hollywood's formulaic library.",

    "commentText": "Del Toro, I didn't want to, but I wound up loving most of your work. Now you've lost me. This trailer is mismarketed and so is this film. It is NOT a 'gothic romance' and it is NOT a 'horror' or a 'thriller'. It just dances back and forth between elements of the three as if you had written all three complete stories in mind and just wound up making aesthetics, NOT the house itself, a key player. You don't even introduce us to the grounds in an ominous enough way or pull out great performances, either. You talked about this being an empowering film for women and it is the opposite of that. There are no clear villains or victims and while that worked in a film like The Devil's Backbone and The Golden Army, it does not work here. We want Hiddleston to be an all-out monster or a hero, not rape-bully and the same is true for the rest of this powerful cast; you got Alice, Loki, and a Jaeger Pilot and used them to form the flimsiest love triangle since The . . . so that was YOU that did that in The Hobbit! The metaphor between butterflies and moths is not nearly as dark as you think, either. It actually seems silly in this setting. While I think this has a place in film like 'Sleepy Hollow' was a Tim Burton film strictly this could be seen as strictly a Del Toro style of film; but are bloodlust for land from our protagonists (that's right, industrialists were just that, not heroic and selfless in the majority of their cases Carnegie was a once in a lifetime guy) and constant undertones of incest that have been building in your films really what you want the world to associate with you? I would've written the ending to show at least a photograph of Edith's mother courting Thomas to hint at either immortality through keeping the house and the two are desperate for that reason as well as isolated, or to find out that Edith's mother is cousin to the Sharpe family and that gives her a bloodlink that allows her to remove that dishonor from the family name. And why wasn't the ghost of her father looking out for her as well? Do you not believe in male ghosts for their own sake, just women's? If Edith could just 'see ghosts' and was not simply intuitive the way an unexplained Stephen King child gets telepathy, then why was she not 'seeing dead people' much, much more unless she could pinpoint her father telling her to ignore them or something? You had an interesting idea, but like so many people in art galleries you only got in a few pieces and didn't take in the depth of the whole exhibit. I think what Stephen King really found scary about your film was its budget, not the story. It's The Fall of the House with The Seven Flowers in the Attic. If you read, you'll be able to see how many disappointing ripoffs were given such a superficial picture. Some people might find this amusing, but I don't think you're sure of the group of messages that will be taken from it and that's not what an artist's approach to expression is.",

Problem lies that it's guiding audience all the time,giving them clues for plot development and than when secrets come out they don't come as a surprise.Ghosts are also done badly,instead of clothing we now see blood vessels,bones etc.Rarely scary,it's haunting in parts but nothing we haven't seen before.Film just does nothing to make viewer think,it just helps him along the way,one of those films that one doesn't have to apply any brain power and conclusion is very predictable.Also film doesn't really go places,most of it is in only 2 locations in US and UK,big mansion that has hidden secrets,nothing we haven't all seen before.",

Now she's older Her imagination has matured Grown darker Now when she falls asleep she no longer sees the nice things She sees images of horror and pain and lost love In the form of ghosts And skinless things And Tom Hiddlestone... Her first love was for a fictional group of spectacular beings, which made her happy and calm Then she grew up and left all her magical loved ones behind Instead growing to love living things She has dived headfirst into real life and is realising how horrible it can be Still living in her head Her dreams are influenced by real life's horrors Underland is a metaphor for childhood, happy dreams and happy love Crimson Peak is adulthood, love and horrors of lost love End!",

    "commentText": "I wonder if maybe in some futuristic society, horror movies will be made that weren't about some \"young and pretty\" woman. You know, like where mankind would realize it's technically possible to tell a horror story with someone from a different demographic acting as the main character-- and that not absolutely everyone wants to see these \"young and hot\" women getting naked and having baths every single time they watch horror. Also, I'm willing to bet the \"shocking secret\" in this movie involves pregnancy in some way, since apparently that's the only sort of story that can possibly happen to female characters. Oh wait, hiddles is in this, so that automatically makes the entire film artistic and deep, and the only way I could possibly be dissatisfied with it is if I'm ignorant and uncultured, right?",

And, Edith tells her brother that he cannot leave her with tears in her eyes and he seemed agitated. I think Edith is a serial killer from a line of them and her brother brings her victims. Perfect setting in a old house that has privacy to do \"whatever\" without anyone questioning them. So, the people she has murdered are now ghosts. It also appears that the older gentlemen at the dance is a victim. His son is probably in love with the wife and will at some point save her. Although the ghosts appear malevolent, some will attempt to tell her and save her. I also think the complication/romance is going to be the brother is going to fall in love with his wife. I cannot wait to see this movie! ;)",

Behind us sat a class of teenagers mostly made up of girls. One of the girls said (before the play began) words that are uncanny to yours. Something of the line of: \"Aaah. I,m not scared but i,m afraid I will be\" she said while holding another girls hands. She was scared even before the play began. And those screams during the play...ahh sweet memories. Your status reminded me of that. Thank your for your status. And since this is Del Toro...it will most likely be terrifying.",

Although as I understand it, the reason King didn't like the movie was that it made it seem like Jack was insane from the beginning, whereas the book was a lot more ambiguous. So if Stephen King didn't like the movie because it didn't represent the character accurately, I think that's fair criticism.",

The house is obviously occupied by the spirits of Silent hill who demand a sacrifice every year to keep themselves satisfied. So the couple try to kill the girl, things happen here and there, and then eventually Nicholas cage will end up burning to Death in a Wickerman and by the end of the film, the whole cycle thing will start up all over again.",

        "commentText": "+Kirsten Hoppins I see the ending as this: After a long time fighting with her inner psyche, and coming to terms with her therapist (can't remember his name) being the manipulating sadist he was, she strengthened her own psyche. You can see Wonderland in the beginning as a terrible place, full of disaster, and in the ending it's like a peaceful fungi forest. Wonderland now seems like a much better place. If you look at some of the last word Cheshire Cat says ‚ÄùForgetting pain is convenient. Remembering it, agonizing. But recovering the truth is worth the suffering. And our Wonderland, though damaged, is safe in memory‚Ä¶ for now.‚Äù. Here Wonderland is Alice's mind, She was ignorant, but somewhat happy (convenient, right?). After she discovered the truth, hell broke loose. It was a time full of disaster (agonizing?). But she pulled through, and overcame her enemy, the therapist (worth the suffering?), and is now safe (Wonderland, though damaged, is safe in memory). In short I think it symbolizes how she overcame her ignorance and pulled through, and is now enlightened and stronger. If you've seen \"Alice: Otherlands (I think it's called)\", you can see that Alice has concurred her own mind, and now enters the minds of others. Through her \"torture\" she's come through victoriously, strong enough enter the minds of others (it can be a symbol though). In the Alice: Otherlands, she says she was afraid of fire (her family?), but isn't anymore. She's overcome her own fear, and is stronger than ever. Sorry for the long reply, but I think it's REALLY interesting! I could go on several hundred lines more, but let's stop here XD",

Thanks for the very detailed explanation I appreciate it :) yeah it's been a year and half since I finished the game and I kind of forgot how it ended though I usually skip the story. But well, does it mean she went sane after she killed the therapist? Yes the wonderlnd was a representation of her mind but did it make her sane? And also what is this otherland? Is it a sequel of the game??",

As the Alice Otherlands, sadly it isn't a sequel, ans American McGee doesn't have the rights to the games anymore (EA has them), so for there to be a new game, Alice Madness Returns needs to get a HUGE boost in popularity, before they would even consider it. Yeah, EA are douchbags. Otherlands is however, some short animations surrounding Alice, and how she's progressed (at least in Alice Otherlands: Leviathan).",

At 1:18, you see the board of the tub push up, meaning there is something locked in there. At 2:01 you see the contents of this one tub, a dead body. But not just any dead body, the body looks to be digested, missing skin and bones, also notice the red goo it is in. Drowned bodies bloat and retain their skins. So the brother and sister kill or trap people then put them in the tubs for the house to eat or digest, giving the brother and sister long life or immortality. Very nice-ah.",

    "commentText": "Oh, I unraveled the plot with enough viewings. The brother and sister are immortal or long lived. They kill people as a sacrifice of some type to keep their immortality. One of the previous victims, the ghost with the longer hair, died in the bathtub which you see at 1:58. The ghost with the long hair, is the mother of the blond girl, whom has been watching over her, protecting her, since she was a baby, which is why she says she has been seeing ghosts all her life. What ties the Blond woman and the ghost with the long hair together, is the baby picture the Blond woman finds at 1:45. The blond woman was there in the past as a baby from the long haired ghost; the male killer is a potential father of hers. Very good story, can't wait to see it.",

There's her mother's ghost and the other people's ghosts that were killed inside that mansion by Thomas (Tom) and her 'sister' but it was really his wife. But there's not a lot of jumpscares so it's good. But this is really violent because they show blood and how they kill each other. It's really violent I can't even. Where Thomas wife killed her father is the worst scene ever I mean they smashed his head onto the sink until it broke and until his head is like smashed and showed all of it omg",

Especially the closed in staircase at 0:15 and the long hallway at 0:17 (though the wall decor has some spikes added here) His name is even quoted in one of the comments for 'this' movie. I wonder if they used parts of that same house? I know the Rose Red house was an old manor that had been turned into separate apartments and then used for the mini-series, while parts of the Rose Red house were set pieces. I'd be very curious to know where Crimson Peak was filmed. In any case, this looks like an actually well done horror movie. I've never been a fan of torture-porn horror, I'd much rather see a creepy good old fashion ghost/monster story, if it's well written of course. With Guillermo Del Toro behind it, I feel like this might actually be enjoyable. Would be nice to have a decent horror movie to see this upcoming Halloween season.",

Mia's an amazing, shape-shifting actress - she works with the most creative directors around: Park chan-Wook, Jim Jarmusch, David Cronenberg, Guillermo Del Toro, to name a few. She also doesn't do badly with her leading men: Tom Hiddelston and Michael Fassbender, etc.",

Some have not been up to par, but for the most part they've all been wonderful. I did find this trailer a bit underwhelming. I've heard much buzz surrounding Crimson Peak and was interested to see the trailer, but I wasn't feeling it. I do think much of it has to do with Mia Wasikowska. I've never been a fan of her's and I tend to lean toward the feeling that she drags down any film that she's in. She usually plays the same character and she doesn't add much life to any scene she's in, and while I hate to base my opinion of her character off a 2 1/2 minute trailer, it does seem like her typical thing. I really wanted to like this trailer. I just didn't. I perked up when I saw Tom Hiddleston but I just couldn't get passed my complete indifference to Wasikowska. I'd rather love her or hate her, but I just don't even care about her which is bad to me. She's like the female Brecken Meyer. They could both disappear and I just wouldn't care. Might go see it when it comes out. Man I really wanted to love this trailer!",

Kristen Stewart starred in a franchise and it's pretty much a universal agreement that she's awful. Same with Jai Courtney. I don't know how that guy keeps getting work. Mia could be really good, but I've yet to see her deliver a performance that made me leave the theater feeling that she blew me away. That's why I'm indifferent towards her. At the same time, she's 25 years old and all those actors and actresses are established people and they're not going to say anything bad about her. What the say is what they're expected to say. Again, I don't hate her. I don't love her either. I just don't care about her. Maybe she'll surprise me in this one. I would love it if she did.",

Mia blew me away the first time I saw her years ago as Sophie on \"In Treatment\" - I immediately called up a friend to tell him about this new brilliant actress. When Meryl Streep accepted her Golden Globe, out of nowhere she brought up Mia's performance in \"Jane Eyre\" calling it \"fantastic\" (Mia wasn't there, and she hadn't been nominated - Meryl just wanted to sing her praises) this was NOT what she was expected to say. It's fine if you don't connect to Mia, but please realize there are many viewers, actors, and directors who do - she just doesn't happen to broadcast on your frequency, so you're not getting the message. That's fine, not everyone will. I'm incredibly excited about seeing Crimson Peak, for Del Toro, for Tom Hiddelston, and most especially, for Mia Wasikowska.",

I've seen five of her films and non of them were the same performance or character type. She's actually quite a versatile actress. Del Toro likened working with her to driving a Porche cause he could ask her to do different approaches and was totally happy with all the results. I like that she's not an over-acting, perky Hollywood actress. She is a very authentic actress with a nuanced intensity and emotion in her. Edward Zwick said, \"her inner life is so vivid that it comes across even when she's being still.\" It seems that most that don't like her saw her in Alice In Wonderland. I didn't see Alice because it looked too froced and contrived. That includes Johnny Depp, Mia and the whole look of it. Maybe she wasn't a good fit, and it has left folks always seeing her as her Alice performance. Although some said she wasn't that bad. She got Alice at 19 and was considered an impressive, young artist out of Australia. She has mostly done quality indie films since or bigger serious films like Defiance and usually partnered with brilliant actors and directors (ie. Michael Fassbender, Edward Zwick ..). Crimson is her return to the big fantasy block buster, and she looks like she hitting the mark to me.",

When you say TV movie I think of one-offs made for the small screen by cable networks like maybe SciFi channel or worse like a lot of Stephen King TV network stuff (though not The Shinning which was made for big screen).

Del Toro knows how to use CGI properly (just go watch Pan's Labyrinth in the few instances where CGI is used. It looks amazing) and is generally quite good at blending the practical effects and the CGI together very well. I don't get this stupid mindset that any use of CGI at all will automatically make a film \"worse\" or something and that practical effects are /always/ better. Even though I'm an advocate for using practical effects as much as possible I've seen plenty of films with practical effects that look awful and plenty of films with CGI that look completely seamless.

I also hope the jump scares are kept to a minimum as well as follow the JS cardinal rule that they have to be earned before using them. First comes tension then the scare.

However, just because I like Guillermo del Toro's work, it doesn't mean I don't see the faults in his artistic direction as well. If the CG ghosts are used sparingly, fine. The trailer however didn't do a very good job at keeping it contained, or messed up on the lighting to make it look at least remotely scary.

They can be right if they're based on having the facts right - and they can be wrong based on having the facts wrong. Behold a demonstration: It's my opinion my neighbor's rooster is getting aggressive. That opinion is true, based on the fact that the stupid bird now chases and pecks the crap out of me. It's also my opinion that Frank Sinatra faked his death and will blow out the candles on his birthday cake this year. That opinion is wrong, because it's based on personal impressions and not on well thought out research, facts, or common sense. That opinion is invalid. I can have the opinion that Batman is cooler than Spider-man or that Halo is way better than Arkham Knight. You can't prove that's wrong or right because it's an opinion which can't be PROVED to be right or wrong. BUT!, I can have the opinion that Robin the Boy Wonder is really Spider-Man. You can totally prove that opinion is wrong. BTW, Arkham Knight is awesome - it makes me wish I was a gamer. Also, my neighbor's rooster HAS started chasing and pecking the crap out of me. I moved to Vermont from San Francisco to be abused by poultry? What the Hell's up with THAT? LOL and have a great weekend. :)",

        "commentText": "+Daniel Mora Arrieta Yeah. You'd think by 1980 every writer would know that filmmakers take your book and need to turn it into THEIR film. Hemingway had that figured out in 1932! You can't do a five hour audio book just to make the writer happy. When King got around to doing \"The Shining\" the way he wanted to, it was over six hours long. I guess if Kubrick had made a six-hour-long film in 1980, King would've been happier! The thing is, even King messed around with the book. His version adds a sappy \"10 years later\" scene where the ghost of Jack looks on proudly as his little boy, Danny, graduates from High school. Aww, how sweet! It's sorta like Obi-Wan Kenobi - but stupid. Now, if Kubrick had tacked that on, King would've trashed the film. Oh, wait - that's what he did, anyway. Here's a funny side note: the Kubrick estate owned partial approval rights to any subsequent remakes of \"The Shining.\" So, King had to get permission - from Kubrick! - to make his six hour epic. Here's the punchline: Kubrick said it was no problem - as long as King stopped trashing Kubrick's version. Now, THAT'S funny . . .! :)",

Funny thing is - or maybe that was the point - because he wasn't following the novel page by page, I got scared because I didn't know what was coming next. If he had done a perfect adaptation, I would've sat there think, \"Yeah. That was the way it was in the book. That, too. And that. Yawn\" It's like Kubrick set out to make sure you freaked out by taking away all the fussy details of the novel you're expecting to see - and focusing on three people in a creepy, isolated place going nuts. I didn't miss the topiary hedge. I didn't miss the ongoing subplot of the boiler which had to be taken care of. I didn't miss Danny's three million conversations with \"Tony.\" And I'm sure King wasn't angry about sales of his novel shooting up because Kubrick picked it up and thought, \"You know, this would make a great film.\" They both rewrote the ending. Kubrick's ending is a brilliant WTF moment. King's finale is \"Full House\" style group hug - with a friendly ghost looking on! One thing's for sure: the stick up King's bum over Kubrick's film seems to be permanent. Despite some REALLY crappy adaptations of his writing, it's \"The Shining\" he won't stop bitching about. I'm sure his tombstone will read \"Here lies Stephen King - The Master of Modern Horror Writers. He was born September 21st, 1947 and Stanley Kubrick really ruined \"The Shining.\" If I were him, I'd be more obsessed with hunting down every copy of \"Maximum Overdrive\" - to make sure no-one ever sees it, again. :) Have a great week!",

Actually is more dramatic than scary for me, the ghost of the mother coming through the door was so beautifully done that it was not so scary at all. So, the two of them has a messed up relationship with the mother, and even shocking sexual relations with each other. The cast is excellent in this film, the final scene made me cry a bit, it reminded me of his early work in The Devil's Backbone Child Ghost.",
