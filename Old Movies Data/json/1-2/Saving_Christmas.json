(clap...clap....clap....), I don't know how Kirk Cameron did it, but he was able to crucify Jesus, as well as Christianity, in the hands, feet, and a special stigmata to everyone's nads who came across to just the trailers alone. Holy FUCK, this movie is more of a cinematic train wreck than The Room, but at least with The Room it didn't metaphorically beat the shit out of you with a bible. It just says to me that \"ALL RELIGIONS ARE DEAD!\". Can this movie be more of an insult? I rather on fucking bath salts, eating my own face while aging backwards than watch this again. most religions still have not yet learned that ONE FUCKING WORD yet, and it's really pissing me off. I feel if anyone watches it, they're going to hell. Cameron should've just concentrated of going to Growing Pains reunions. IF this somehow replaces A Christmas Story on TBS, I swear to god, Stu....",

It was meant as a celebration of the winter solstice. Many many years ago it was adopted by Christians and celebrated together by all people, non-Christians and Christians alike. That's why there's the Christmas tree and gifts and Santa Clause. These are all of pagan origin. It is not and never was Christian holiday, thus it can't be saved or taken back, as it was stolen by Christians in the first place. In other words, this movie is horseshit.",

PROS: Laughably tries to justify brainless Christmas materialism denies that Christianity co-opted Pagan traditions. Writing for token black character is offensively bad and at times verges on entertaining. 'Actor' who plays Kirk Cameron's sister looks like a meth addict. Santa is portrayed as both violent and rapey. CONS: Ssssssssllllllllloooooowwwwww...some characters, especially the Jewwy-looking guy who plays Kirk Cameron's brother-in-law, deliver their lines with long, unnecessary pauses between words. I suspect this is to pad the run time. Most of movie takes place in a stationary vehicle.",

Yes, there are many cheesy movies,but only a small percentage of them are Christian. The most beautiful Christian stories are actual Christian testimonies and biographies. The new version of \"The Hiding Place\" is critically acclaimed. I haven't seen it, but the old one was also very moving.",

    "commentText": "I love how people here are saying that Christians are being judgmental and hateful towards anybody who thinks differently. Yet what most of everybody is saying here is just not true. Many actual Christians (and not just those who claim to be) do not hate anything but evil. We don't hate people, we just hate sin, which is something everyone, even ourselves, commit. I also am getting a kick out of how people are saying we are the majority. That just isn't true anymore. There are a lot of people out there who claim to be Christian but they actually are not due to the fact that they don't seek a personal relationship with Jesus. So, in fact, the actual, Bible-believing, Christ-seeking Christians, like Mr. Cameron, are very few and far between and become increasingly so everyday.",

Honestly I love the concept and message but the execution was too corny and unfunny. I actually don't like accepting presents during Christmas because I feel like the holiday (which is pagan) should be a time to celebrate Christ (if you are Christian), be a better person, and/or to spend time with friends and family. Yeah I don't know when Christ was born but it is the thought that counts at the end.",

Watching this film is like drinking fine champagne, and its influence is the biggest in filmmaking history since the invention of the moving image. I found myself crying throughout the film, and laughing at other times. The film is full of beauty and humor and is one of the best films I've seen since I saw the premiere of Orson Welles' \"Citizen Kane\" and Francis Ford Dopealla's \"Apocalypse Now\". The experimental quality of the film reminds me of Kenneth Anger's \"Scorpio Rising\", the underground film that had a heavy impact on Martin Scorsese's film career. After Scorsese sees this, we know what his new inspiration is ! No, not Fellini, not Rossellini, KIRK CAMERON! I'm signing off, now, the police are shooting at my door after they found out that I was the one who actually murdered John Lennon. Say, \"The Catcher in the Rye\" is a sweet book.

So I guess Kirk is equally as ignorant about his own precious holy book as he is about, oh, evolutionary biology.",

    "commentText": ".Kirk if you ever see this message, please read it through. Hear me out, this message is with love. Consider this, do you think it was by chance that this movie was rated the worst movie of all time? Yahushua(Jesus) is giving you a sign, please understand it. Since Yahushua(Jesus) was not born on dec 25th it was never about Yahushua(Jesus) to begin with and its a perpetual lie telling anyone he was. The simplicity of that alone should be a red flag. You have come off the path, and the teaching of this movie are very dangerous. Read below........ Exodus 32: 5And when Aaron saw it, he built an altar before it; and Aaron made proclamation, and said, To morrow is a feast to the LORD. 6And they rose up early on the morrow, and offered burnt offerings, and brought peace offerings; and the people sat down to eat and to drink, and rose up to play. Moses Informed of Israel's Sin 7And the LORD said unto Moses, Go, get thee down; for thy people, which thou broughtest out of the land of Egypt, have corrupted themselves: 8They have turned aside quickly out of the way which I commanded them: Mark 7: 6He answered and said unto them, Well hath Esaias prophesied of you hypocrites, as it is written, This people honoureth me with their lips, but their heart is far from me. 7Howbeit in vain do they worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men. 8For laying aside the commandment of God, ye hold the tradition of men, 2 Peter 3: 16As also in all his epistles, speaking in them of these things; in which are some things hard to be understood, which they that are unlearned and unstable wrest, as they do also the other scriptures, unto their own destruction. 17Ye therefore, beloved, seeing ye know these things before, beware lest ye also, being led away with the error of the wicked, fall from your own stedfastness. Matthew 5: 19Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments, and shall teach men so, he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven: but whosoever shall do and teach them, the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven. Deuteronomy 18: 9When thou art come into the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee, thou shalt not learn to do after the abominations of those nations. Deuteronomy 12: 1These are the statutes and judgments, which ye shall observe to do in the land, which the LORD God of thy fathers giveth thee to possess it, all the days that ye live upon the earth. 2Ye shall utterly destroy all the places, wherein the nations which ye shall possess served their gods, upon the high mountains, and upon the hills, and under every green tree: 3And ye shall overthrow their altars, and break their pillars, and burn their groves with fire; and ye shall hew down the graven images of their gods, and destroy the names of them out of that place. 4Ye shall not do so unto the LORD your God. Ezekiel 8: 14Then he brought me to the door of the gate of the LORD'S house which was toward the north; and, behold, there sat women weeping for Tammuz. 15Then said he unto me, Hast thou seen this, O son of man? turn thee yet again, and thou shalt see greater abominations than these. 16And he brought me into the inner court of the LORD'S house, and, behold, at the door of the temple of the LORD, between the porch and the altar, were about five and twenty men, with their backs toward the temple of the LORD, and their faces toward the east; and they worshipped the sun toward the east. 17Then he said unto me, Hast thou seen this, O son of man? Is it a light thing to the house of Judah that they commit the abominations which they commit here? for they have filled the land with violence, and have returned to provoke me to anger: and, lo, they put the branch to their nose. 18Therefore will I also deal in fury: mine eye shall not spare, neither will I have pity: and though they cry in mine ears with a loud voice, yet will I not hear them. Deuteronomy 4: 2Ye shall not add unto the word which I command you, neither shall ye diminish ought from it, that ye may keep the commandments of the LORD your God which I command you. Proverbs 14: 12There is a way which seemeth right unto a man, but the end thereof are the ways of death.",

Well the holiday has the word \"Christ,\" so to say that it has nothing to do with Jesus is ridiculous and you guys lack knowledge in history. Yes! I do understand that before Christianity dominated Europe, pegan holidays and rituals were observed during the times of the winter solstice. But when Christianity came about the celebrations were abolished (like Saturnalia and Yule) and by the 3rd century the Church established that Dec 25 is the feast of the Nativity of Christ (Christ Mass) translated later to Christmas. Look I know you guys have a hate for religion, but to bury real history to argue your viewpoints is the definition of bigotry and ignorance.",

    "commentText": "lol atheists saying Jesus was not born on December 25th and that Christmas is a \"pagan\" holiday as if these are original criticisms that have not been addressed ad nauseum. When you only stick to your lib/atheist propaganda books, shows, etc where these claims are constantly reiterated, I guess you start to believe they are valid. However, nobody claimed Jesus was definitely born on December 25. It's unknown exactly why this date was chosen. One theory is that The Annunciation (Mary being told of her pregnancy with Jesus) took place on March 25 so his birth would be around December 25. Another theory is that December 25 was chosen to counteract pagan celebrations around this time. Still others suggest it was chosen around this time because it was Winter, days were shorter and thus people had more time for celebration, festivals, etc. That so-called \"pagan\" traditions (Christmas Tree, Yule Log) may have infiltrated Christmas is irrelevant because the point of Christmas remains to celebrate Christ. It's like saying because the USA observes Mexican traditions, like Cinco de Mayo, the USA is really Mexican. In fact, the term \"Christmas\" comes from & means \"Christ Mass.\"",

    "commentText": "As a theatre major who has had to write many critiques... blah blah blah my experience makes my opinion valid. If you ignore the message it still looks like a shitty movie. Everyone including the extras look and sound like they're over acting. The set for the living room doesn't look homey. The floor looks like white plastic the decorations look like someone just haphazardly threw them in there. Santa looks fake as fuck and the kids aren't fooled by it. The lighting is way too bright in the house. Unless they're lighting their house with football stadium lights nobody's house is that bright. This leads to problems in that it washes out the actors' faces, and gives it a fake feel. When movies look fake audiences don't like it because subconsciously they are comparing it to real life so that they can find something to identify with to make it seem real. Meaning the more like someone's home a house looks the more someone will like it because their brain associates it with their own memories. The car part reminds me of a sonic commercial. A lot of the things he's saying are right \"Jesus wasn't born in December\" and \"pagan symbols\" I don't get why he's pissed off. If he knows that Jesus wasn't born in December why is he celebrating Jesus' birthday at that time of year. If he knows that these are pagan symbols you'd think he'd know that Christians stole Yule from the Pagans. More stadium lights for the birth of Jesus cut away. It's not even \"it's so glorious Jesus is born\" it's Mary is sitting in the middle of the road and a car is coming. After the \"Amen\" literally all of the extras look into the camera instead of at the man on the floor where real people would naturally look. Also is nobody going to help him off of the floor. Yay you just slid across the floor possibly ruining someone's gift we're going to celebrate that and stare off into space while you get yourself up. That's just an analysis of the trailer I couldn't imagine doing one of the whole movie.",

    "commentText": "I'm a Catholic and I seriously can't stand people like Kirk Cameron and Ken Ham. They are destroying the foundations of our faith. They make people think that Jesus Christ wasn't even real (which historically he was real, wether or not he was the messiah is up to people's opinion) I highly doubt though that within 20 years Christianity will die out. Someone here wrote that knowledge and logic will destroy Christianity, however that is only the case for \"Young-Earth Creationism\". Young Earthers, in my opinion, are not true Christians, they are ignorant, cruel, and close-minded people, they are basically their own religion. As much as anti-theists deny it, most Christians accept evolution, and the big bang theory. In fact the person who first thought of the big bang theory was \"Georges Lemaitre\" who was Christian. Of course there are people who want to deny evolution because they have no true understanding of the bible. The catholic church has accepted evolution for decades now. In fact The Pope recently said even that \"Evolution and big bang are true, and that God isn't a magician who waves his wand\" Also God isn't a Genie, so he can't just do every wish you command. I hope Pope Francis restores Christianity, because once he dies people will always remember him for his love, peacefulness, and kindness, which is the Christian thing to do. But nobody will remember Ken Ham, or Richard Dawkins, or Ray Comfort. Because they are just ignorant. The pope even said there will be a possibilty of life on other planets, and this is a guy who's read the bible over 500 times, who is a theoligion, a linguist, and a person who has understood the many interpretations of the bible. Because Priests, cardinals, and Jesuits have to study the bible, language, history, and all religion for 12 years, so I'm pretty sure they know what they're talking about more than basically every Christian and Atheist in this comment section.",

    "commentText": "Should Christians Observe Holidays? The question of observing holidays is addressed in God’s word. After all, many early Christians had recently departed their Jewish faith. What were they to do with the many holidays that their friends and family still observed? Some chose to make a complete separation from their past traditions, others put those customs to use. “Who are you to judge another's servant? To his own master he stands or falls. Indeed, he will be made to stand, for God is able to make him stand. One person esteems one day above another; another esteems every day alike. Let each be fully convinced in his own mind. He who observes the day, observes it to the Lord; and he who does not observe the day, to the Lord he does not observe it. He who eats, eats to the Lord, for he gives God thanks; and he who does not eat, to the Lord he does not eat, and gives God thanks. For none of us lives to himself, and no one dies to himself. For if we live, we live to the Lord; and if we die, we die to the Lord. Therefore, whether we live or die, we are the Lord's” (Romans 14:4-8). Paul’s words are puzzling to those who know how forcefully Paul argued against bringing Jewish customs into the church. However, recall that Paul observed Jewish customs at times. In Acts 21:20-26 you can read were Paul complied with the ordinances for purification even though the law of Moses was no longer in effect. Paul explains this in I Corinthians 9:19-22, “For though I am free from all men, I have made myself a servant to all, that I might win the more; and to the Jews I became as a Jew, that I might win Jews; to those who are under the law, as under the law, that I might win those who are under the law; to those who are without law, as without law (not being without law toward God, but under law toward Christ), that I might win those who are without law; to the weak I became as weak, that I might win the weak. I have become all things to all men, that I might by all means save some.” Paul’s goal was to teach people about Christ, yet the people he approached all have personal biases and expectations of what constitutes religious practice. So long as those practices did not violate what a Christian must do, Paul was willing to personally conform himself to those expectations in order to have opportunity to teach people. He strongly stated that it was wrong to bind these foreign practices on the church, but as an individual he had some liberty. In other words, if a Jew came out of Judaism and desired to continue to celebrate Passover with his family, such was not wrong as an individual. As a Christian he knows that the requirement for observing Passover had ended when Jesus died on the cross (Colossians 2:14). Thus to him it is not a religious feast, but a secular one. Yet, by keeping it he is accepted in the Jewish community and has opportunities to teach about Christ. The actual keeping of the feast does not violate any command of Christ. Another Jew coming into Christianity enjoys the freedom that it provides and decides to make a complete break from Judaism. He chooses to not to follow any of the past customs. Should he look down at his fellow Christian who is still observing some of the Jewish customs? “But why do you judge your brother? Or why do you show contempt for your brother? For we shall all stand before the judgment seat of Christ. For it is written: \"As I live, says the LORD, Every knee shall bow to Me, And every tongue shall confess to God.\" So then each of us shall give account of himself to God.” (Romans 14:10-12). I’m sure that some ex-Jews had a difficult time eating pork after a lifetime of avoiding it. But the truth is that it doesn’t matter if a person, as an individual, decides not eat ham. “I know and am convinced by the Lord Jesus that there is nothing unclean of itself; but to him who considers anything to be unclean, to him it is unclean” (Romans 14:14). Should then, the person who chooses to follow his old customs look down on his fellow Christian who does not do so? “So let no one judge you in food or in drink, or regarding a festival or a new moon or sabbaths, which are a shadow of things to come, but the substance is of Christ” (Colossians 2:16-17). It is a two-way street. “Let not him who eats despise him who does not eat, and let not him who does not eat judge him who eats; for God has received him” (Romans 14:3). The key is the fact that neither person is violating the laws of God. “Do you have faith? Have it to yourself before God. Happy is he who does not condemn himself in what he approves” (Romans 14:22). But such liberty in individual choice does not translate into new laws for the church. While an ex-Jew might choose not eat pork, he cannot bind on all Christians a ban from pork. “For every creature of God is good, and nothing is to be refused if it is received with thanksgiving” (I Timothy 4:4). A person who decides to enter a synagogue and join in the Sabbath observance cannot tell other Christians that they must observe the Sabbath as well. Therefore, we reach the point where we need to ask, can Christians observe secular holidays? Many brethren observe the Fourth of July, Memorial Day, and Mother’s Day without a second thought as to whether they are right or wrong. These days are merely days set aside to enjoy special occasions. But like the old Jewish customs, it would be wrong to bring these secular holidays into the church. For example, Mother’s Day is slowly being pulled into the denominations and becoming a part of their religious practices. If I chose to remember my mother on a particular day of the year, that is my business, but I cannot create a special day for the church to remember mothers because God did not authorize it. But what about Christmas? It began in idolatry and false religious practice, so how can a Christian participate in it? The question is: does it continue to be viewed as idolatry? As an example, the days of our week are named after false gods. Should Christians not use those names because of their connection to idolatry? No, because no one makes the connection these days. To make an appointment on Tuesday doesn’t cause anyone to assume that you are a pagan. The fact that Christmas originated in pagan and false religious practice ought to make us pause and consider. But the same question needs to be asked: does my participating in the celebration cause others to make the wrong conclusion about my beliefs? I doubt anyone today would conclude that those celebrating Christmas are pagan idolaters. However, since Christmas and Easter are recognized as religious holidays, some observing us may think we are also keeping these holidays as a religious requirement. This could be a cause of concern. So, consider this: when you see decorative lights on a house, do you assume the owners are celebrating Christmas as a religious holiday? I think most would honestly say, “No.” I know atheist and Jews who put up decorated trees and give out gifts. Thus Christmas is no longer strongly associated with Christianity. In fact, those in denominations are complaining that Christmas has lost its religious significance. That is why so many are chanting slogans, such as “Put Christ back into Christmas.” When people ask me what I’m doing to celebrate Easter at the congregation, I say, “The same thing we do every Sunday.” The puzzled looks give me an opportunity to show them the passages proving that Christ’s death is to be remembered every Sunday. Yet, we still decorate our home with pastel items and hide brightly colored eggs for the children. Nothing religious is connected with Easter in our home, but as a social custom we enjoy the holiday. We are able to enjoy Christmas as well without turning it into a religious holiday. I don’t have stars on my tree or a nativity scene in my yard. I can sing carols, but I skip the ones that speak of Bethlehem, angels, mangers, wise men, holy nights, and shepherds. I leave religion out of my holidays because God did not authorize them, but it doesn’t mean I must cross the holidays off my calendar. What about my brothers who strongly object to certain holiday observances? “Therefore let us not judge one another anymore, but rather resolve this, not to put a stumbling block or a cause to fall in our brother's way” (Romans 14:13). I’m going to try my best not to cause offense. If I know someone objects to Christmas, I’m not going to invite them over for a turkey dinner on December 25th. There are plenty of other occasions to get together without my making things awkward for them. The instructions found in Romans 14 are often misapplied to situations they were never intended. But we mustn’t forget to learn and use those laws in their proper context.",

This is basically radical Christians that are upset that they can't have 100% control over all aspects of the holiday. If people try to speak against this, then they have the world's biggest persecution complex. \"Oh, woe is me, no one respects my religious beliefs and everyone just wants to destroy my religion!!\" Fuck them and they're stupid fucking war on Christmas.",

What is it about hiding behind a keyboard that makes people so full of hate and the feeling of being negative? As an atheist myself I could careless about this movie but i dont feel threatened by it nor do i need to come here to troll becasue i feel superior to other peoples believes and values. If you believe in Christianity quite frankly this looks like a great move for the whole family to watch. Some of you people go find a hobby if Youtube makes you so angry and full of contempt.",

If you watch the interview with Kirk Cameron which most likely would appear in the suggested videos he is asked his views on homosexuality and gay marriage. He beats around the bush so much its obvious that he just doesn't want to appear as a intolerant bigot. Funny how Christianity is supposed to be about accepting others and not judging people yet they do the exact opposite. If you want a real cringe worthy laugh check out the youtuber TheVigilantChristian. A complete nutjob who links just about anything to Satan and an Illuminati conspiracy. Watch the video about the X-Men films. More anti-LGBT bigotry and even equates such things with pedophilia somehow. X-Men are mutants so one of the messages that they are trying to convey is to be open and accepting of people even those who might be different from you. A great message that applies to real life be it race, sexual orientation, etc. Instead of pointing out that positive value he just insults it as Satanic and evil.",

Honestly, I'd give the movie credit for having at least one unlikable Christian (Such as a middle-aged curmudgeon who screams at his lesbian neighbors) and a likable atheist. The film's message was basically: Atheists are just angry at God. Atheists cannot be angry with something they don't believe in. At the end, Radisson just gets killed. Josh does not offer him his hand after he breaks down due to the death of his mother. I mean, simply God 'took away' his mother and he did not get at least a cliché 'God works in mysterious ways' from Josh towards Radisson, he just bounced back to the ironic and brutal 'Why do you hate something you deny'. I think Radisson's mother's death at 13 wasn't a sudden drive to atheism, I bet he went through tough shit in foster care that confirmed his 'atheism' (According to the film's logic).",

Say you got into an argument with a friend, your significant other cheats on you, someone murders one of your loved ones, or any other scenario that leaves you mad at the person. I don't think anyone's solution is to just assert that they don't exist. Why should this apply to God? Most people who arrive at atheism got there through logical thinking. They found lack of evidence to support the existence of God and find the teachings and outlandish claims to be too far fetched to believe. Horrible things and wonderful things happen to people on a daily basis. There is no deep meaning behind it. It is either random or just the result of circumstances. I think it is kind of foolish to think everything happens for a reason, God works in mysterious ways, or it was all part of God's plan. Sure, it might give some people some comfort to believe this but that doesn't make it true. I'd rather go with the truth than a comforting lie.",

I also don't understand how we can buy presents for each other when Christ was basically the LEAST Materialistic person to ever walk the Earth...... I guess Christmas is a man-made day for Christ...because I don't remember Christ saying..\"Celebrate my BIRTH by giving gifts and presents to your loved ones\". Jesus just wants us to remember him for what he did for us EVERYDAY of our lives(not just Christmas)....Because I know no one man would do as much as Jesus did for us.",

The fairy tale of Jesus (whether he actually did live or not) I'm not talking about him actually being a fairy tale; but rather a fiction in the bible. Son of god.. MY @$$!! This is about as much propaganda you can possibly squeeze into a few hours on film and it sucks. A LOT! If people really buy into this shit that's their problem but I can't possibly see why anyone would. after all this video currently as i am posting this comment has over 7,000 dislikes and only a few hundred likes. this movie is a piece of trash and should be treated as such.",

This isn't just the worst christmas movie or worst christian movie, it Is thee WORST. MOVIE. EVER. CREATED. It's supposed to have a comedic undertone but I don't think a single person laughed the entire time. Even my friend thought it was terrible and she was the target audience. It's simply an hour of apologist propaganda. It's chock full of historical inaccuracies and other absurdities. The logic used in this movie is like trying to prove New Jersey exists by saying you were born on a monday. If you have ever seen Kirk Cameron talk about bananas, it's like changing banana to christmas and then making it into a movie. I have never uttered the phrase, \"are you fucking serious\" so many times in the matter of 60 minutes. If you want a movie that lectures you and treats you like you're the biggest imbecile on the face of the planet then this movie is for you. For everyone else, you will want to avoid this movie entirely or risk blowing your brains out. You will get a pistol purchase permit, get the background check, buy the gun and a single bullet, and wait the three days just so you can kill yourself for having watched this abomination. This movie isn't even fit for a made-for-youtube film. Kirk Cameron, you are a horrible human being for making this. This movie alone is proof there is no god.",

It was the Corrupted leaders that led everyone to war. Religion itself may not be your cup of tea, but it can give moral backlight and give hope to the hopeless.",

If you were to abolish all religion because it has no place in a civilized, free, and modern society, you're only telling people they have no freedom of thought or freedom in general. I don't know why people would support that. If that's how people really want things to be, I'm glad I'll be dead before that happens because it's not progress. That's major regression. I'm really struck by how little deep thought is going on here amongst people who think they're enlightened because they're Atheists/anti-religion. It's ridiculous. I'm not even religious, but I have the ability to listen and no blindly oppose based on things that are false. by saying religion shouldn't exist, you're saying people can't have freedom of thought. By saying religion has no place in a free or civilized society, you're failing to look at what religion is about.",

I also thought God was all knowing and all powerful. Why did he create such a mess when he knew how it was gonna end? If he didn't saw this coming, he isn't all-knowing. If he couldn't create anything better, he isn't all powerful. If you want to justify your judging of the LBGT community by using the bible, go ahead. Just realize that the bible is the cause of a lot of people getting hurt. If you really need a book to tell you what's good and bad in this world, you don't have any real morals to start with.

I mean the book of Job is all full of morals where god tortures Job for a bet. How about Samson killing about as many people as the attack on 9/11. You also can't lust even though everyone lusts over someone. Also when we do something bad we ask for forgiveness no matter how bad it is and you will be freed. There is no punishment. Religion did affect cultures like when the pilgrims came to america and the oppression of the church. If you look at history like the puritan times, you will notice the witch trials. This killed innocent men and women over obscure if any definition of a witch. The church during the dark ages oppressed people if they didn't believe in god and you will burned by the stake you heathen/heretic. But if look at modern examples look at 9/11 and the shooting at a french newspaper place over pictures of muhammad. How about the war on terrorism with George Bush mentioning that either god gave him a vision or god told him... or some shit. Religion really isn't good.",

    "commentText": "There is no war on Christmas, I love Christmas regardless of the fact that I do NOT believe in ANY deity. I love the music (even the religious songs), the food, and the presence of family, as I grew up a Christian. I have no problem with the term \"Merry Christmas\" I say it every year. However, I also say \"Happy Holidays\" to people I don't know personally, because they may be of another tradition( there are many winter season holidays) and I live in America where many traditions take place. Saying \"Happy Holidays\" is not an attack on Christmas, it is respect for those of other traditions. I don't understand why this is so hard to understand. However, I have studied the history of how these \"Christmas\" stories came about. Jesus's Birthday Despite Christmas being associated with the birth of Jesus Christ, there is no biblical passage or other evidence establishing Jesus's date of birth. In early-to-mid 4th century, The Western Christian Church set the date of Christmas to December 25 as a means to rival existing solstice celebrations, and was later also adopted in the East. While there is no established date for the birth of Jesus, the following passage from Luke 2:8-12[3] seem to suggest that he was born during the lambing season: \"And there were shepherds living out in the fields nearby, keeping watch over their flocks at night. An angel of the Lord appeared to them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were terrified. But the angel said to them, “Do not be afraid. I bring you good news that will cause great joy for all the people. Today in the town of David a Savior has been born to you; he is the Messiah, the Lord. This will be a sign to you: You will find a baby wrapped in cloths and lying in a manger.”\" Natalis Invicti Natalis Invicti (\"birthday of the unconquered one\") was a festival celebrating the rebirth of the sun, Sol Invictus (\"Invincible Sun\"), the official sun god of the Roman Empire. Scholars argue that the festival was placed on the date of the winter solstice as the sun would seemingly reverse its retreat and thereby prove itself unconquered. Early Christian writers connected the rebirth of the sun with the birth of Jesus Christ, and the festival is believed to be responsible for the date of Christmas. Saturnalia Saturnalia is an ancient Roman celebration of Saturn, the youngest of the Titans and father of the gods in Roman and Greek mythology. While originally only celebrated for a day, it grew to a week-long celebration starting at December 17 and ending at December 23. Besides the public rites involved in the festival, there were also a series of holidays and customs celebrated privately. The celebrations included a school holiday, gift-giving and a special market. Yule Yule is a winter festival taking place on December 25, and was initially celebrated by the Germanic people as a pagan religious festival. The festival was later absorbed into the Christian festival of Christmas. Customs such as the Yule log, the Yule goat, the Christmas ham, wassailing etc. all come from Yule. Controversies War on Christmas The term War on Christmas gained traction in the early 2000s, thanks to conservative commentators such as Fox News's Bill O'Reilly. The term is used to denote the alleged censorship of Christmas, and how the use of terms and phrases such as Xmas and Happy Holidays are, as Fox News host John Gibson puts it, a \"liberal plot to ban the sacred Christmas holiday\". Scientist and former White House senior policy analyst Jeff Schweitzer stated that \"there is no war\", and \"Christians like Bill O'Reilly have declared war on religious freedom, demanding that the United States convert to a Christian nation\", referring to their insistence that stores and the like should use language which is explicitly Christian.",

But you cannot take that holiday, say it's ONLY for you and your people, and then use it as an excuse to boss other people around. When an atheist (like myself) celebrates Christmas however they like, nobody has taken or is trying to change anything for YOU. I will spend my holiday(s) however I want and it's my own business that I don't go marching about telling people what they should and shouldn't do for a particular day every year.

    "commentText": "\"'Happy Holidays' or 'Seasons Greetings'. . . whatever that means. . .\" Well, I can see how this may be confusing, but let's take this as a question of semantics. \"Happy\" or \"Greetings\" (in this context) are commonly used lexical units to wish well to individuals and/or express an amicably-natured salutation, ex: \"Happy Birthday, Chuck!\" or \"Greetings from Chicago\". \"Holiday\" can be seen as an umbrella term for any day that celebrates an event, idea, deity, etc and that is given special status by/in a state, country, town, religion, culture, etc., which are often based off recorded history, cultural/religious memory, etc. and differ according to region, religion, etc.; for specific examples of \"Holidays\" see Wikipedia or anyone you know who is familiar with this concept. \"Happy Holidays\" is used by one individual to express well-wishing, joyousness and sheer merriment to another individual on a non-specific level, based off the presumption that the receiver will celebrate/celebrates any of a number of days which would be classified as a \"Holiday\" at the given time of year. \"Season\" denotes a stretch of time varying in length, but in this case specifically refers (at least in some Western cultures) to a brief period of time (sp. December/January) where several holidays (see above definition) are being actively celebrated by people in the area, community, etc. The phrase \"Seasons Greetings\" is a not uncommon way of recognizing that enough people celebrate any one or more of the holidays celebrated at this often festive time of year for it not to be a weird thing to say. These phrases exist because people come from different backgrounds and celebrate different things and have different ideologies and therefore it should not be assumed that everyone is on the same page when it comes to who celebrates what and why. This from a polyglot. (For the record, this was just a sarcastic rant, not something prepared for scholarly criticism.) :)",

Does it just feel good to say those things, or are you sure you aren't just wasting your time? I may not agree with everything Atheists or Jews or Pagans have to say, but I don't condemn them as something less than me. I put on my clothes the same as everyone else. Just because you disagree with something (idea, method, etc.) doesn't give your beliefs any more credit. I'm going to continue celebrating Christmas because, to me, it is more than the birth of Jesus, and is a symbol of a new beginning for mankind, when my God showed humility to the world. I only hope you can show some humility among each other. Happy Holidays. With Love ~ The Mink",

    "commentText": "I believe that Christmas is a combination of religious symbolism and pagan symbolism. Many traditions like mistletoe or a Christmas tree are traditions passed down over generations that aren't related to Christ's birth. Other religious symbols, like the Nativity scene, or certain carols like \"O Holy Night\", \"What Child Is This?\", and \"Away in a Manger\" have been passed down over generations and can be credited to Christianity. This means that for Christians in America, we get to celebrate Christmas in the way that it was intended for us, centered around Christ's birth and giving of ourselves. I agree that we as Christians should start giving back more on Christmas rather than making our Christmas lists and shopping too much. This year I started doing that by helping the homeless on Christmas Day. Atheists are free to celebrate Christmas too, for what it means to them. Hanging lights on their house, decorating a Christmas tree, hanging stockings, spending time with family... They are still free to enjoy their traditions as well. We should stop arguing over \"who stole Christmas from who\" and \"if it's really religious or not\". I say we all just enjoy this time of year, whether you are religious or not, and we spend time giving of ourselves and enjoying time with family in peace and harmony. We should just enjoy the season in peace instead of fighting over who owns the holiday. Believe what you believe, do traditions with your family, and let others do the same, even if you disagree. This is the best time of the year where we get to be thankful for everything we have. Christians: We can be thankful that we even get to celebrate Christ's birth in America. Atheists: You get to be thankful that you have freedom to practice your traditions as well. Peace be with you all this holiday season.",

    "commentText": "What the four-eye says is actually true. Basically nothing in Christmas has anything at all to do with the Bible. Its origins are pagan (do a bit of research on the origin of Christmas and how it was introduced into Christianity), and none of the traditions and symbolism is biblical, but much of it is taken from pagan cultures. Christmas is like a mish-mash of pagan traditions (many of which go blatantly against what the Bible commands). Moreover, there isn't even one single example of the followers of Jesus celebrating his birth or commanding others to do so. (Of course from a scholarly point of view the entire narrative of Jesus' birth is most probably completely fictional, invented and written down almost 100 years after it allegedly happened, but that's an entire topic in itself.) \"Put Christ back in Christmas\" is quite a misnomer because Christ has never been in Christmas. Personally I'd recommend doing the exact opposite: Remove \"Christ\" from Christmas. Excise all religious baggage from it, and celebrate it for what it is: A joyous occasion of family reunion, socialization, gift-giving and appreciation.",

Then there were more of course but I went into Christianity because of my own mom's moves and it was through the military when I started learning more about the falseness in these beliefs and more. Their god's true personality shows within their very bible, any time it shows his very nature, you can't help but see him as a terrible person, incompetent in some ways, a liar, murderer, and more. Not something I would want to accept blindly. Nobody should just BLINDLY believe something though, they should be able to look into these things and decide for themselves where they feel they belong and what they would believe in.

You are simply making assumptions, which is concieving a weak argument. The Councils of Nicea and Trent didn't create the Bible either! They were a group of Catholics that discussed the Bible. Your statement made no sense. Evolution does not exist. There is no fossils th",

First you come up with an hypothesis, then you describe your method, then your control and experiment...several times. If you get the same result each time, then you submit your findings for peer review. Your peers will go hell for leather to disprove your theory, However if they can't and they yield the same results, then your theory is accepted as true. What you have done is the classic religtard move. The problem is the burden of proof of god's existence is down to you!!!! YOU have to prove he exists because I don't believe he does. Do you understand the concept? As for evolution...ok...the fossil record...there's your proof. or are you one of those morons who believes dinosaurs were on the ark...please say you believe that...I need a laugh...",

        "commentText": "+hornetgags Mhm kay. Thay's not even what I started of this argument to be. I started this by asking \"How did the Universe start, then?\" Then you athiests came around all angry avoiding the question and trying to sound like world-class scientists. Then you came along. I stated the fact that the New Testemant of the Bible is a historical document because it is full of first person accounts that thousands of other Jews witnessed and recorded. We have all those recordings in museums. They are all carbon dated and match up with the events in the Bible. Look it up bud. Then you come along, angry, itching to start a fight and look smart, like most athiests do. I love your quote, for ironic reasons, \"If you can prove Evolution is false, then there's a Nobel Prize waiting for you.\" Are you kidding me? That is one of themost hypocritical, absurd, false statements I have heard from an athiest. If you can prove Evolution IS true, you deserve a Nobel prize, since you are obviously the smartest guy in the World, Hornetgags. Not to mention, you have been avoiding the essential question this whole time. According to Evolution, how did the Universe begin? Also, I took note of how you made stupid, unproven assumptions to look intelligent, like \"The Bible was stolen from ancient scrolls.\" Are you even TRYING? I can make idiotic, arrogant assumptions about your beliefs too, watch. Watch. Evolution is just a scam to make money for Charles Darwin. There. According to your logic with arguing, I win. Nope. It's done. Then you say that the fossil record is proof for Evolution. Huh? Yeah, we did find a few deformed skulls, but things happen to bones when they've been pressurized under litterally TONS of Earth for thousands of years, or, according to Evolution, MILLIONS of years, which even further proves my point. What makes everyone of your comments even more pitiful is that you're AVOIDING THE ESSENTIAL QUESTION THAT I ASKED IN THE VERY, VERY BEGGINING. Even in your latest comment, all you did was restate the Scientific Method. That litterally answers my question in no way. I've never heard of an athiest who could. You just add to the list of athiests who can't, which is all of them.",

We don't know what it feels like we don't know what happens, all we know is that you don't wake up. Now to me I guess its more of a comfort to think that once we die there is a possibility that you might (even through some sort of simulated memories) see a loved one rather than the alternative. Finally to tackle whether its a bad thing or a good thing, to me its not bad nor its good because the world as I know it is gone when I die however for others who are left behind that were part of my life and who cared for me for them it is a bad thing, because well it is a loss of a loved one.

        "commentText": "+Kevin Tysick +Special Agent Fox Mulder Okay guys, this link does a decent job of gathering secular 3rd hand accounts of Jesus: http://y-jesus.com/is-there-any-evidence-from-secular-sources-that-jesus-even-existed/ and here's that quick google search Kevin: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historicity_of_Jesus \"Criterion of embarrassment\", gents? Now, obviously I speak from a stance of ignorance, as do we all. I cannot say with certainty he was real or not, but the proof and logic lends to him being a real figure. I simply find it ludicrous,as to what other explanation there is for Jesus? I don't care if it goes against your beliefs, or you don't like it. If it's truth it's truth, and to go against it for said reasons makes you a Christian's equal.. Just bear that in mind. Simple logic garners dismissal of a majority of other claims. And for the record, incase you didn't catch it, still not a Christian. Was. But no longer. So let's look at claims against him: Is he made up? Doubtful, the crucifixion, baptism.. If he was made up it seems a bit backwards to have a \"sinless man\" be baptized which was for \"remission of sin\". Also, his words are kinda against the norm of thinking at the time. I just can't think of alot of people this happens to in history. If this was a common occurrence, it would make sense to use such a claim.. But it just seems... Kinda fuckin dumb? (and by common occurrence, you can easily come up with examples, but it'd take a while to explain exactly what I meant.) \"Anti-Roman Propoganda\" Idk.. If he was exclusively made up for that reason... You think you'd see WAYY more of that in his teachings, or as a extremely common theme. I mean, he actually was attempted to be tricked by the Jews into inciting a rebellion against the romans and got out of it.. (When they asked him if they should pay taxes and his answer was \"render unto ceasar what is caesars and render unto God what is God's\") \"He was a legend made up by Romans to quell Jews\" Haha, huh? How was a man claiming to be their One God gonna calm them down? How was a man preaching against the hypocritical figures of the jewish leaders (who in the Biblical scriptures atleast, didn't want trouble with Romans) helping Romans? How was painting a Roman Leader as someone who lets a murderer go and crucifies an innocent man, helping the Romans? As you can see, that argument pretty much completely disregards to Biblical text. Not to mention what happened to early Christians.. They were massacred and persecuted terribly by the Roman Emperors, before Constantine made it a mandatory religion.. (again, how does that help Rome? Christianity helped destroy Rome.) The only real argument against him is basically discrediting the Biblical gospels entirely, but that takes a lot to do. Don't get me wrong, easy to disprove them as \"Innerant Word of God' but to completely ignore them is stupid. The texts were supposedly written from first hand accounts of people who knew him and traveled with him, even at the time of their writing the writers DIED for said beliefs, and the writing was passed around and believed to be inspired by God even then. As you can see, it's actually harder to disprove him then to prove him. I've given you some proof and logical conclusions against your two's opinions in a respectful manner. Now do likewise and provide me some sources, and logical conclusions against my opinion in a respectful manner.",

A moral approach based on science is worthless, because, according to science, even consciousness is an illusion. If consciousness is an illusion (isn't real), then there is no intrinsic value to it. Therefore, life of any kind has no intrinsic value!! Atheists will then ironically try to preach Humanism, in which morality is derived from the values of any given culture. This is fucking stupid, because as I said earlier, without any inherent value in human life, what would guide anyone's behavior? \"A social need for acceptance\" is science's explanation....But it isn't really an explanation, because it boils down to, \"What are my values?\" \"They're the same as everyone else's.\" \"Why?\" \"Because that's what I've been taught.\" \"Why?\" \"Because the situation my culture is in lends itself to those values.\" But situations change. If you internalize the guidance of the Bible and the peace that comes from knowing God, your values don't change based on the situation; you operate throughout your life with integrity, regardless of what other are doing, and virtually every Christian who truly practices can tell you that it brings inner peace and inner power to an incredible degree Religion's most dedicated followers come from those who think we need to have deeper values than those which so happen to be socially acceptable on this day, with this group of people. Religion is also for people who are disgusted by the scientific community's unspoken and persistent assertion that the human experience is worthless. Fuck Bill Nye, fuck Neil DeGrasse Tyson, fuck Stephen Hawking, and fuck Richard Dawkins. I'm tired of those assholes telling me that everything I experience is just an illusion. Go read some real authors, like Origen, like Descartes, like Einstein even (he was agnostic but truly open-minded).

I don't need to live in comstant fear of an almighty sociopath sending me to a land of fire and brimstone for all eternity if I don't believe in him, so that I can know not to enslave people (funny enough, the bible says nothing against slaves. In fact, that same book spends a few passages detailing the logistics and mechanics of slave trade.) I also derive my morality from evolution. Contrary to what you ignorantly hold to be true, morality is evolutionary advantageous, as it allows an intelligent species to have a set of values by which to order and structuralize their society for the common good. By making an absolute statement such as the one you've made (and I quote: \" You ABSOLUTELY cannot have morality without religion), you imply that nobody before the year 0 had moral values.

It's the middle fence between Atheism and Theism, but is much closer to Atheism if anything. He explicitly said that be believed the word \"God\", as commonly used by the masses, was just an expression of human ignorance and a desire to feel special. He didn't believe in transcendence, nor did he believe in an afterlife. He simply realized that there \"must\" have been an original source of creation. Perhaps an everlasting, omnipotent force which created the universe for some unknown purpose, then stopped concerning itslef with petty human matters. Unlike you, he wasn't arrogant enough to assert that the creator of the universe was concerned with him, or human morality, or that be revealed himself to others, without any evidence. 3. The book of revelations that I assume you're referring to should best be renames to \"Book of Obvious Predictions\". Everything it mentions (hunger, war, kickers and scoffers, etc) have always been around. Our time period doesn't have anything exclusive to it that discerns it from other time periods. Here's a challenge: point me to one time in recorded human history when the things predicted in the bible WEREN'T happening. 4. I don't understand how you can claim that the creator of the universe, in all his glory, decided to reveal to you how to be \"good\" or \"bad\". You are arrogant enough to believe that he made the entirety of the universe for your personal pleasure, and that he gives a shit regarding what you do with your genitals in private (and other ridiculous biblical prohibitions.) 5. One of the primary ways for me to discern between good and bad is by envisioning the consequences. Every action is carried out by people because of a deep-rooted fear of consequences. I restrain from killing, because I fear: guilt, legal repercussions, social outcasting, etc. My motives for doing good are generally a mixture of a fear of consequences, and a desire for reward. I give charity because I fear: guilt (for not giving), and social rejection by those who observed me not giving when urged to. I also anticipate praise (for when I do it), and that warm feeling you get from seeing a smile on a homeless man's face. 6. I didn't insult your intelligence. I just called you ignorant. Notice the difference. 7. You do realize that Stephen Hawking now holds the same position that was once held by Sir Isaac Newton, right? He knows more about the universe than you probaky ever will. I'm not trying to resort to the authority fallacy here. I'm just reminding you not to reject the works of a living genius, and not to pontificate in matters you don't fully understand yet. 8. A great example of morality without god is Bill Gates (I'm sure you've heard of him.) He donated hundreds of millions (maybe even billions) to charity, out of pure kindness. He's also an atheist.",

Sure, there are still a few idiots who fall for its emotional manipulation, but they'll soon realize what fools they've been. People are becoming more and more open-minded. And then there's radical groups like ISIS and the Muslim world, but those will be wither wiped out, or overwhelmed within the next few decades. I may have exaggerated by anticipating its fall to occur within 20 years, but 60 to 80 more years is a reasonable prediction.",

If a monkey miscalculated the distance between one branch to another, he was a dead monkey. Over time, as humans became more social and intelligent, they became faced with other, non-survival related problems. Cultural differences led people to try and solve issues between each-other. Not only has this led to intelligent human analysis, but it also allowed us to formalize our solutions to problems in ways that \"made sense\", which gave birth to logic, and subsequently, philosophy.",

It's just a holiday that is made to get you to spend money there's no real religious property to it. You shouldn't be trying to shove your religion down other peoples throats like that. The world does not revolve around Christians other people have opinions too you know. Not every holiday that we celebrate has to be religious. Can't we have a bit of fun and just throw more money out the window buying useless toys we'll never play with. This movie is a perfect example why people these days don't like Christians anymore and don't want to be part of the religion. It's sad really it is.

In fact, MOST of the traditions are actually Pagan. Nowhere in the bible does it state that Jesus was even born anywhere close to December. Modern Christmas is a media manufactured consumerist holiday. Early Christians would have wanted to hang you for heresy. By Comparison Hanukkah retains its historical religious and cultural practices and has for hundreds of years. Also wow, another shot at my boyfriend for being Muslim.

Yes, the practice of christianity has morphed over the years with the change in our culture, are you claiming hanukkah to be immune to this phenomenon? I remember the kids at my school getting jealous of the jewish kids because they got 7 times as many presents as we did, one batch for every day of hanukkah, in fact now that I think of it I dont think Ive ever met a jew that didnt receive presents on hanukkah, not that I have anything against that, since most of these gift receiving traditions usually try to instill the joy of giving into people. The fact that you would actually try and sit there, sniffing your own farts as one commenter mentioned, while claiming superiority over another religion because you think that your holiday is truer to its origins than christmas, is fucking absurd. Early christians would have hung me? Early jews would have stoned you for dating a muslim, and probably having sex with him out of wedlock, whats your point? Oh and I would advise against calling people a bigot and an islamaphobe in an actual debate, it makes you look desperate, and for the record I dont have anything against muslims. My muslim boyfriend comment was used to make fun of you, not him, you were the one who brought him up in the first place, assuming someone is an islamaphobe because they made an incredibly vague comment about your boyfriend just makes you look like an SJW retard.",

He was born to a wealthy family, but sold all of his riches and gave money/gifts to the poor. His tradition carried on for centuries and he transformed into Santa Claus. It's certainly true that Christmas, today, has changed a great deal. However, it's still a time for family, for recognizing/worshiping Jesus, and definitely still a time for charitable giving. Btw, if you want to read an interesting article about Christ's true birth date, check this out: http://www.biblicalarchaeology.org/daily/biblical-topics/new-testament/how-december-25-became-christmas/ Very cool and eye-opening information.",

    "commentText": "Christmas trees represent Jesus, I mean anybody can see that clearly. The cross was actually made out of a Christmas tree. Elves are a huge part of the bible also not to mention snow and tinsel because all of these where present in Judea. Yes all of Christmas as we know it directly represents Jesus and even though I know everything I have said is false lying for Jesus is also all about Jesus. I wish they could sensor this page and remove all the negative reviews and bad comments. I dearly want these people to be fleeced by Kirk and forced to sit through his movie. If you let them know you are mitigating the chances these tards will punish themselves. You also got to hand it to Kirk, the man knows how to stack paper and as retarded as he seems in interviews i refuse to believe anybody with that good of a business head on them does not know its bullshit. The dude produces profits, I bet half of you would do the same if given the chance.",

We have people of multiple religions here. That is why Ads have been saying \"happy holidays\" and \"seasons greetings\". It's because they are trying to cater to every belief so they can bring in more money during this time of year. They aren't trying to \"take Christ out of Christmas\" if you want to say \"merry Christmas\" then you still can. Nothing is going to take that away and neither is anything going to try. Another thing you need to think about that there are a lot of holidays being celebrated at this time of year. Hence the term \"happy holidays\". One of those holidays is Christmas.",

This movie looks ¡SO BORING!, (i mean, you have a guy crashing into a present, AND YOU CAN'T WRITE A JOKE) and doesn't have a reason to exist, if you wanna celebrate Jesus birth, you can, a big part of the celebration is about him, and only douchebags care enought about it to make fun of you or jesus on christmas, if not everyone celebrate a Jesus focus christmas is not an attack agains religion, and forcing everyone to celebrate this as a christian party is an attack agains freedom of faith. Can't we all just stop making bad religious films and if you like religion just see \"Jesus Christ Superstar\" or \"The prince of egipt\"? they're not christmas related, but they have God or Jesus and are kick ass movies.",

That's not how actual people talk, they don't sound like that, and the actors don't help. They all have a serious case of \"actor voice\". They sound like they're reading their lines (and they all for some reason sound like they're trying to be Sarah Palin in some way, at least that's what I hear), they look like they're forcing their gestures, it doesn't seem like it's real to them. And it's NOT FUNNY. The part where the black man was acting like it was a baptist church service did not make me chuckle, or chortle, or giggle, or smirk. It sounded like someone trying to write a black person based on stereotypes. Also, the camera work is fucking shotty. Can the camera operator hold the camera fucking still on a fucking still shot?! Seriously, if you can't do it, GET A TRIPOD! You're probably filming with a cheep enough camera that they build tripods for it looking at the quality. This looks like it was made by some armature youtuber with window's movie maker filters. Some shots are just awkward, like the one at knee height of the dancing people. Why did we view them from that angle? It's just weird and jarring. It doesn't look artistic. And the sets, Jesus Christ, the sets! They look like they're from the 1980's! Nothing looks real, it all looks like it's fake, like it's plastic. The filmed version of \"Twelfth Night\" from 1988 had more realistic sets than this, and one of them was just a painted backdrop of a mountain.",

It always seems to be a theme that these preachers follow, out wright lieing which in my experience the creationists are the most guilty of.

And Santa is fat, not because he constantly eats cookies, but because he houses the BODY of the CHRIST! Santa Claus is Jesus! ... Haha, fuck that shit. Xmas is pagan, and it's much better like that than praising some divinity that was based on other divinities. ... Also, Santa Claus is Thor (yup, very true.

Shocker, a Christian being unable to handle criticism. I know, I know, not like that's ever happened before or constantly. Lols. It's actually kind of sad that Christians make this nonsense. I mean the movie reeks of Christian persecution complex. Now apparently us mean ol' atheists are out to take Christmas away from them like a real life Grinch. Of course they never seem to remember that they stole these traditions from the pagans. And even then oh no, not people wanting to say happy holidays instead of Merry Christmas. Dear god no.

A butthurt creationist dork throwing a hissy fit because I spoke out against one of his favorite apologists who tells him whatever he wants to hear because he's too intellectually dishonest to care whether his beliefs are true. How original. Do you feel better now that you threw that hissy fit as a butthurt response to my comment?",

        "commentText": "+Pastor John Lancaster I don't need to see the film nor do I need to do so to make a judgment on it. From what I can see the movie is a piece of propaganda based on typical Christian Persecution complex which is why he seems so delusional into making a movie to \"save\" Christmas. The film has received numerous negative reviews not just from Atheists too mind you but from Christians as well and the guy attempted to falsely boost his own ratings and it back fired. He's earned everything he's getting and his film deserves to be mocked and insulted. People shouldn't have to see his movie before they reserve judgment and they're not dishonest for insulting him just because they haven't seen it. It's not half obvious what the films going to be like. The acting is poor, it has a token black guy who acts exactly like black people in blaxploitation films do, the main Character is trying to \"save\" Christmas from people thinking Christmas is based on stolen pagan traditions which is actually a violation of known facts (Christmas really IS based on pagan mythology, Jesus birthday was actually sometime in the fall) and finally one of the other issues the film is blowing out of proportion is the fact that some people say happy holidays instead of merry Christmas, I mean come on man. It's a sad and pathetic film and no one should have to sit through the entire thing if they don't want to just to meet YOUR standards. It's not dishonest to insult a movie based of its reviews or it's trailers or even off the knowledge that the film's content is based on denying reality. Our opinion's on the film are honest. I honestly think it's garbage. And I probably will watch it later on for the sake of amusement. It's always fun watching an idiot try to make sure everyone understands that his false view of reality is fact.",

        "commentText": "+SuperDelusionist While it may be true that there aren't any solid evidence - what \"solid\" even means is debatable here - that Jesus existed, it still is not out of the plane of possibility that he did exist as a crazed fool claiming to be the son of god. besides, we have crazed fools claiming to be the son of god all the time. Heck, I think there were already a handful since the turn of the century alone. So, it is the reasonable position to reserve judgement and allow for the possibility than to outright negate it and assert positively that he never existed. When you assert in the positive that he did not exist - yes, that's an assertion. Even a negation is an assertion - it is up to you to provide evidence since you are making the positive claim. The burden of proof does not fall on the one reserving judgement and making no claim either way. I understand a few people google a few fallacies and think they are Bertrand Russell, but logic is much more involved than a few fallacies, but I digress. I personally don't feel that he did exist even as a man by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, but I would never make the positive assertion that he did not exist or that some nut thinking he was the son of god existed since there are at least a handful alive today. It's probably a moot point anyway. I think what we must argue here is whether or not the son of god or god existed, never mind a crazy man, because crazy men have existed, do exist, and always will exist. The question is whether or not some crazy man had dealings with god, and that is a claim the needs extraordinary evidence. That's the claim that is absurd. If someone says, \"do you think Jesus existed.\" I say, \"surely some man named Jesus existed but was he the chosen son of god capable of miracles, and to that I say, 'absolutely not.' There is no evidence for gods yet much to contradict the existence of a god so there would be no reason to suppose a \"chosen son\" of a god. If and when you can show the existence of a god, we can then debate the validity of a chosen son of god. Until that time, while there may have well been a crazed man named Jesus, there is no reason to suppose he was as he claimed.\"",

My dad's got a better camera than that (I'm not one for pictures) and it cost him £200 (ish) and a tripod for £30. How do you know this wasn't made on movie maker? I could. I agree, you are rather stupid (despirate does not mean desperate). Actors are desperate, as they are desperate to get the word of the lord out, and are blinded by faith. At what point did I say he recorded the trailer seperately? You're just making crap up now. Please \"think about what you're saying you little shit nugget! have a nice day.\"",

The catholics celebrate masses, so they called it Christ Mass or Christmas as it has become known. They could have named it Super Jesus Awesome Fun Day if they felt froggy.

Since my family and I are not celebrating what the world tell us to do and celebrating the real feast of YHWH (Passoven, unleaven bread, shavuot, yom teruyah, yom kippur and sukkot), He really appreciate that we are doing Biblie thing in Biblie ways, in His way noy our way. and our live have changed and very blessed. He is the one to be worship, so we have to do what He comand us to do. And christmas, easter, halloween or Sundays are noy in His calendar, but are in the enemies calendar and we are decived as Eve was, believing evil lies. I pray that our Heavenly Father open the eyes of His people, because greatest is He, that one that is in the world. Praise Yehova!!!! In Yeshua's name, Amen",

Because I'm finding all these people reading Torah these days and trying to get back to doing what YHWH actually told us to do in the beginning. Crazy huh? I mean, why would we want to obey God when we are having so much fun doing it all our own ways, right? And so, I figured I'd stand up and say, 'Forget all that (doing what the Bible says) stuff! I want to do things the way I'm used to doing them! So, I had to give the ONE voice of truth in the whole movie some 'new eyes'. I talked to some historians, (you know, the ones who supported my theories). I used them as my MAIN SOURCES - not that silly ol' Bible. And when people question me about this, I tell then, \"Hey! I used to be pagan. So why not continue doing pagan things in YHWHs name!? Kirk, people that follow Torah are not the dumb! We know what we believe and we stand for it. I have a question to all those people that think we \"should save\" Christmas. Is Jesus Gods Son? Wouldn't Jesus follow His Fathers Law? The Torah. If we call ourselves Christians aren't we suppose to follow in the steps our Messiah? That's was the lamest argument about Christmas in your movie. Watch 119 Ministries \"Sunburned\"",

The bible never said anything about the EXACT date of Jesus' birth. All it suggested that he was born around 1 BC. The world celebrates the birth of christ on December 25th. That doesn't necessarily mean he was born on that date. And just because \"christmas\" has the word/prefix \"christ\" in it, doesn't actually indicate the actual birth of Christ. Like I said, the world celebrates the birth of christ on Dec. 25, but really, no one knows when he was born. In fact, the bible never even mentions his birth date. December 25th is just a cultural holiday. It doesn't indicate anything.",

Christmas is for anyone who deeply identifies with christ … i.e. Christ-mas Christ, a man nailed to a cross, being tortured. In no uncertain terms … a Torture Symbol. Anybody who deeply identifies with a Torture Symbol is not mentally healthy. Why do the mentally ill Identify with \"Torture\" The US(for instance) is one of the world leaders for torturing children … (Child Abuse) Those abused children, grow up, and now IDENTIFY DEEPLY with Christ … a Symbol of Torture.

There are dissenting ideas about why the date was chosen (e.g., some say that it has to do with a belief that the conception happened 9 months earlier) since it is not believed he was born in December (I think currently there is some evidence he was born in April? but don't quote me on that one). The celebrating of Christmas started in the 4th century when Christianity was made the official state belief of the Roman Empire (after years of Christian persecution). Because it was no longer being persecuted this is when Christianity started to flourish and they started to really define their beliefs, and also started to celebrate the birth of Christ. Through time the various already established traditions surrounding the winter equinox, etc started to attach themselves to the holiday. So everything you said about the origins of the tree and yule log and all that are accurate, but the word Christmas is to celebrate the birth of Christ. I do agree the best way to celebrate it, whatever you celebrate it for, is by helping your fellow man though, since to me the holiday is all about the spirit of giving!

What we should be saying is that the traditions observed at Christmas have nothing to do with Jesus, because they're pagan in origin, but like any other celebration, the event itself has all the meaning the people observing it are willing to give it. On the other hand, Christians are not engaging us on the argument we're intending to make. Saying \"Christmas is about Christ because it's in the name\" does nothing to disprove the pagan origin of the date and the traditions - that's pretty much impossible, unless you somehow manage to find actual evidence to the contrary. The name itself isn't evidence, it's just a name, likely given in an attempt to christianise Yule, thus making it easier to convert Europeans - it's much easier to convince people to change their religion if the new religion's celebrations are basically the ones they've been observing anyway. So, in closing: Christians, your holiday is about whatever you want it to be about - just be aware that the traditions aren't Christian in origin. However, don't insist on other people observing it the same way as you do. Let people say \"Happy Holidays\" or \"Season's Greetings\", because some of us want to still celebrate the winter solstice in any number of ways (or at least be polite when someone wishes us \"Merry Christmas\"). And don't be upset when people put up their own displays that don't show the nativity scene - they're just celebrating their own holiday. Show some tolerance, please.",

The Churches renamed it Christmas when they stole the holiday. Also the word Christ isn't exactly original. In Fact X in Some old languages means Christ, that's why you see Merry X-Mas on some holiday signs. Also, since most of the bible is pagan it could have stolen the word Christ, I'm not saying that's what happened as i don't know if it did but it could have happened. Just because i have something in the name that is in another religion doesn't mean my holiday belongs to that religion. What if i named my religion Andrewism, and everyone named Andrew is now by default part of my religion, how is that fair, Most likely the Church just changed the name when they stole the holiday but just because It's called Christmas doesn't mean it revolves around Christ and in this case it doesn't. It's like if i made Spider man the mascot of fucking Thanksgiving, just because i put it in there and it stuck a bit with some stupid asshole Americans it doesn't mean thanksgiving is about Spider man.",

Theist logic xD There's nothing original about Christianity, it's all borrowed and copied from other older religions. The church needed to assimilate pagan traditions in order to make the transition from pagan to christian smoother. It's a very well known fact and the church does not deny that. Being from scandinavia a lot of the christian holidays are being reverted back to the original meaning, which is a good thing I guess? lol Anywho, the amount of distortion a lot of christians have about their own religion is mind bogling and makes you wonder if they believe anything you tell them, albeit it provides enough incentive for them.",

He was born on December 25th and we should honor Shrek's sacrifice as one of the 17 divine gods: Akotosh, Mara, Talos, Molag Bal, Mehrune's Dagon, Celestia, Luna, Shrek, Rat Boy Genius, Amazing Atheist, Illuminati, Arceus, Helix Fossil, Night Mother, Sithis, Yzmir-Nalirc Sil, and Satan! Shrek is love, Shrek is life... Shrek is the omega, Shrek is the Alpha... Shrek is might, Shrek is strength... Shrek is god, Shrek is everything... Shrek is the beginning, Shrek is the end.... Shrek is Ruby, Shrek is Saphire.... If you have not accept the ogre lord into your life, I urge you to come see me and help you accept the holy onion and the ogre lord into your life....... For if you do not accept him, he will impale you with his ogrely eshrekted dick then proceed to fuck your corpse until he lets out his onion passion all ogre your body so you'll go to Savangaurd and not have to suffer hell.... However, if you are unfortunate enough to hear anything about Shrek, don't worry, for the second you are born, there is a spot waiting for you in Savangaurd, however, the second you know who Shrek is and you know about the holy onion and movies, then the only way to get that spot in Savangaurd is to accept the ogre lord into your life... You can worship other gods also, but all the ogre lord asks is to be somewhere in your life for he loves you for who you are, not for what he wants you to be... Shrek is love, Shrek is life..... Amen <3 (Please note that this is a joke made to make fun of this movie)",

Don't tell me you're serious... The holiday of December 25th originated as a Pagan winter solstice, later reformed by Rome as the Saturnalia. The Saturnalia celebrated the rebirth of the sun god as Saturn. It was further celebrated under the title Yule in various other locations in Europe. In 350 CE, the Pope claimed the Saturnalia as a Christian observance.",

I'm just saying, whether you're a believer or not, it should be okay, and more so, common practice to know and understand that we may not know, at all, what is best for our neighbors upon this shit heap we've found ourselves, and that as such, we should not proclaim what is best for each other.

Which I know is not what you're trying to say, but there is a mistake that some people make, wherein they lump all of Christianity in with the imbeciles in Westboro; as if Christianity at its core pleaded its members to cruelty, and yes, that is in there on occasion, but it is not the main message, it is not the main goal. It would be equatable to lumping all of Islam into Islamic extremists; which, obviously, is wrong. I think we're on the same page here. Look, I disagree with the people who claim that people are 'committing war upon Christmas,' and likewise, I disagree with Kirk Cameron here. Nobody intends to erase Christmas, in fact, you could make the argument that Christmas is longer and more ingrained into American society now than it has ever been. What the folks who, like Kirk Cameron, fail to realize is that although we're attempting to be more sensitive to people of other religions, or of no religion at all is that nobody is trying to erase Christmas, we're just making room for a more culturally diverse world, and America. Which is a good thing. But to them, obviously, it isn''t. That being said, all Christians, obviously, don't believe this, just a few bad eggs in a bigger basket.",

There is much better evidence for the existence of Santa Claus than there is for Jesus existing. By the way, Easter is named for a Sumerian Goddess of fertility and her name was Ishtar and it is pronounced, Easter. The Romans and the Christian church hijacked all the pagan celebrations and give them some Christian bull shit twist. For instance Candlemass, or Groundhogs day is from the Pagan celebration of Imbolc and the Goddess Brigid and the coming of spring and the strengthening of the Sun God who was born at Yule, he is born on the winter solstice every year. Saint Valentines day is from the Roman Pagan practice of Lupercalia, check that one out sometime, it looked bizarre and fun, but not for dogs and goats though. Saint John's day is the summer solstice when the Sun God is at his peak power. Lammas or Loaf Mass is from the Pagan Celtic Lughnassadh, where the Sun God is sacrificed for the beginning of the harvest. He is sacrificed every year and reborn again at yule the Winter Solstice every year. Of course the 23.5 degree tilt of the earth in our orbit around the Sun cause this but it is fun to celebrate the Earth's journey with these celebrations. The point is, Christianity is a huge lie. Since Jesus and Mary also figure into the Koran, it too is another huge lie. Ask me for my proof of Santa, it is a fantastic and true story.",

She wrapped him in cloths and placed him in a manger, because there was no guest room available for them. 8 And there were shepherds living out in the fields nearby, keeping watch over their flocks at night. 9 An angel of the Lord appeared to them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were terrified. 10 But the angel said to them, “Do not be afraid. I bring you good news that will cause great joy for all the people. 11 Today in the town of David a Savior has been born to you; he is the Messiah, the Lord. 12 This will be a sign to you: You will find a baby wrapped in cloths and lying in a manger.” 13 Suddenly a great company of the heavenly host appeared with the angel, praising God and saying, 14 “Glory to God in the highest heaven, and on earth peace to those on whom his favor rests.” 15 When the angels had left them and gone into heaven, the shepherds said to one another, “Let’s go to Bethlehem and see this thing that has happened, which the Lord has told us about.” 16 So they hurried off and found Mary and Joseph, and the baby, who was lying in the manger. 17 When they had seen him, they spread the word concerning what had been told them about this child, 18 and all who heard it were amazed at what the shepherds said to them. 19 But Mary treasured up all these things and pondered them in her heart. 20 The shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all the things they had heard and seen, which were just as they had been told.",

Paul likely wrote Romans while residing at Corinth sometime between A.D. 55 and A.D. 57., two decades after Jesus' death. The first written account of the ministry of Jesus, the Gospel of Mark, was penned in about 65 to 80 CE, 30 or more years after Jesus was allegedly executed. Importantly, there's not a single contemporary writing from Romans during the time Jesus lived despite the Romans being quite prolific. Not one. Christian apologist websites won't admit this. Wouldn't you think that some Romans would write about a man who claimed to be the son of God, did amazing miracles and then was resurrected? Also note that Jesus didn't correct even one of the many major errors in the bible (Adam and Eve, order of the formation of the universe, the shape, movement and age of the earth, Noah's flood etc.). Gee, I wonder why? Learn the history of your own \"holy book\" so you won't look so ignorant.",

The Gospels, the stories don't match between disciples. The city of Nazareth didn't exist at the time Jesus was supposed to have been alive. There was a reference by the Roman governor of Egypt about Jesus in manuscripts written by monks. The original work however, did not mention Jesus at all. The monks just put it in to keep the story going. They needed some legitimacy, even if it was a lie. There is no record of a Yeshua ben Joseph existing. That is what Jesus would have been called. I really wanted the Jesus story to be real and true but, it isn't. I do believe in God though. There is a story in the Hebrew Talmud about two Magi who were vying for position of the top Magi to the King of Babylon. They were Yeshua and Judas. To win the position they were in a competition flying these aircraft called Shem. Yeshua's Shem crashed and Yeshua was killed and Judas became the top Magi.",

After two thousand years of people being forced to worship this Jesus or be tortured and killed it has to be a lie or they wouldn't have had to use coercion. The really damning evidence is the history of the \"The Limbo Babies\" . This just shows what a bunch of liars the Christian church has been for centuries. So, Edgar Cayce says there is a God, our real selves are just like this God. What we see in the mirror looks nothing like God or our real selves and we really have no gender in the cosmic scheme of everything. I like it. Get one of the books about Cayce and check it out for yourself.",

In his book \"The Jesus the jews Never Knew\", Page 37, author Frank Zindler discusses how Flavius Josephus was not contemporary of Jesus or John the Baptist but was a contemporary of Paul the evangelist. Josephus never writes about anything in the new testament in his works of history of the time \"The Life of Flavius Josephus, the Antiquities of the Jews, and the wars of the Jews. At no time does Josephus mention a miracle man from Nazareth. He doesn't even mention Pau the Evangelist. However; translations of his works in Greek prove to be added in by monks because they are not in context with anything else around the passages and not found in original manuscripts. The christian Monks were trying to create a history of a man who never existed. One other piece of evidence, the city of Nazareth did not exist at the time Jesus was supposed to have lived. So, how could he have been \"Jesus of Nazareth\"?",

For one, not a single middle eastern or Mediterranean Christian uses the term \"Easter,\" they use a variation of the term \"Pascha.\" The term Easter only starts popping up after the 8th century, and only in Germanic lands. Why? Because \"Easter\" comes from Germanic paganism -- not Mesopotamian paganism. It might seem like a minor point, but it makes the difference between someone who repeats something he read off of a meme vs. someone who actually did their homework.

It might seem so, but remember that it was written by jewish scholars with political interests and roman poets (and both were possibly using psychedelics since there weren't prohibitions like today). So it's a giant metaphorical trip. Adam is not a person. Adam could be a gene, or the population of men that had this evolutionary threshold (evolution is still a thing, it's debatable whether it's linear as in darwinism or not, i personally bet that it's not), which made them more sexual. Thus, they outbred the others. In the same sense, buddha and jesus aren't persons, they could be simply metaphors and titles for people who posses a certain ability. Heck, jesus christ wasn't even a name, since christ comes from greek (meaning savior). Maybe there was a revolutionary that was called christ, but looking for evidence about a magical zombie jew would be a waste since that book was written to control simpletons, and as a tool for those that know how to interpret it, not just be spoon fed by the 'true' interpreters child-rapists priests.",

There is overwhelming evidence that Jesus existed. It would be impossible to explain the Gospels without the ministry of a historical Jesus (which is not to say that the Gospels are gospel true). It would be even harder to explain Paul's letters since he was on intimate terms with Peter and James. Who would these men be if Jesus never existed? Josephus also mentions Jesus and James (there is an interpolation in the text at the point where he mentions Jesus, but the mention of Jesus is secure from other authors who quoted the mention of Jesus before the interpolation entered the mss. tradition). Easter is named after a Saxon goddess-nothing to do with Ishtar, whose name was pronounced Ishtar (I wonder how you convinced yourself to think it was anything other than an insane fantasy to claim her name was pronounced 'easter'). If you were not completely ignorant of to her languages, you would know that in all other languages than English, Easter is called by a derivative of the root Pasch which is a technical term from the Bible. You seem to be under the impression that the story of the resurrection was fabricated the Saxons converted...or something. Just like bible thumpers your thought is too muddled to fully understand what you mean. One could go on, but you get the point.",

They said that chivalry and the altruism of Christians was dead... your unbelief is your choice Ummm, no it isn't. We don't get to actively choose what we believe. Beliefs are a matter of conviction (being convinced). What we will and will not believe is due, directly, to what we will accept as justification (e.g. evidence. reason, blind/naive faith, etc) for those beliefs. I am convinced by the overwhelming evidence presented relative to the typical writing style of Josephus, and the lack of flow to the story as to where all the stuff about the Jesus character was thrown in. Had we any surviving original copies of those books, we would have been able to compare handwriting style, and we might even have known if it was actually present in those originals. As it stands, the only surviving copies we have, hold a questionable history. So, even if I could accept the story as reported by Josephus, I'd still have to question the authenticity due to the history of those books, themselves. And, even then, as far as I'm aware, the Josephus account doesn't mention all the miracles. We also have to question the authenticity of any account that has Nazareth as the birthplace of Jesus, since it didn't exist as a settlement of any kind at the time of Jesus. No, there are too many inconsistencies to consider Jesus a real person, or even inspired by a real person. However, there were several people running around at that time claiming to be the prophesied messiah, including John the Baptist. In fact, there is probably more evidence of John the Baptist than of Jesus, who wasn't mentioned by anyone, including Josephus, until decades after his death.",

Josephus experts (there are about a dozen of them) have been agreed now for many years that the Testimonium Flavianaum was inserted into the text at a point where J. briefly mentions Jesus. the original text, including the mention of Jesus is quoted in the manuscripts of Origen without the Testimonium. And in an other place J. mentions James, who can only have any historical importance as Jesus' brother. You can look this up, for instance, in James H, Chalresworth's The Messiah. I wouldn't exactly call Josephus honorable however. by his own account he was in command of a company of Jewish soldiers during the revolt and got them cornered inside a cave. He encouraged his men to kill themselves rather than surrender to the Romans (which they did), after which he promptly surrendered and changed sides.",

After all, if I'm stubborn enough, I can simply admit to his existence and deny his divinity (if my biases rule me). I'd like to believe (even if it isn't actually so) that I would be convinced by evidence one way or the other. And, were there compelling evidence for the existence of a Jesus character, whether or not that person existed as described in the Bible, I would accept that evidence, and it's obvious conclusions. Have you ever heard of Dr. Richard Carrier? He cites several reasons for being convinced that the Jesus character of the Bible was not real, nor was he based on any actually existing, singular person, but may well have been an amalgamation.",

At the very least, the common consensus is that the biblical depictions are certainly entirely fictionalized, and ad hoc (i.e. pieced together from different sources). Look up Richard Carrier, D.M. Murdock, and Robert M. Price. All of these people were firm believers when they started their research, and firmly convinced to the contrary by the time they finished. In fact, Robert Price was still religious and preaching even while arguing against the historicity of the Jesus/Christ character.

Let's not forget that Paul would have been bout 32 at the time Josephus was born. and dead by the time Josephus was 30. So, we have a time frame of roughly (guestimating) about 15 years they could, potentially have become familiar with one another. However, Josephus, by all accounts was not even born till about or at least 4 years after Jesus is supposed to have been crucified. So, He could not possibly have been familiar with Jesus in any way, and would have had difficulty confirming whether or not James was truly the brother of Jesus, even if he knew James personally at some point in time. Also. we should not forget that Jesus, in his sermon on the mount is quoted as having said that all Christians/messianic believing Jews were his brothers and sisters in faith. Also, James' blood relation to Jesus (assuming both of the persons actually existed in the world, regardless of their divinity) is hotly disputed, for which there is zero evidence.",

Murdock give compelling arguments about that. Also, reading the Bible, it is easy to see that there are varying accounts that cannot all be true, simultaneously about the same individual, and it's a difficult circle to square. Too many parallels with other deities. If there ever was a historical Jesus he was nothing like the one depicted in the Bible. So, to say there was such a historical figure, and then associate him in any way with the biblical figure, would be stupid, and highly incredible. Prior to these revelations, I had no reason to doubt the existence of a person on whom the biblical narrative may have been built. However, there is precisely nothing to suggest even that much. That is not to say there was never anyone named Jesus, at that time, or prior. On the contrary, the name was quite popular then as it is today. But, I don't see any difference in suggesting that a man named Abraham living today is the basis for the Abraham character in the Bible. In fact, there is little, if anything, in the Bible which can be construed as historically accurate, or even loosely based on historical persons. For instance, the Moses narrative is well known to have been mythological since there is nothing to suggest that Jews were never enslaved in ancient Egypt, and since it matches other Egyptian myths, about the Egyptian people rather than the Hebrews (Israelites). I don't mean a Jesus that was formed by church history either, I mean the historical Jesus. How, pray tell, would you suggest distinguishing between the two? After all, all we can know about this Jesus character, who would have been historical, is by church/canonical dogma. Otherwise, there is no sense in even talking about a historical Jesus. We might as well be talking about the Mexican gardener, Jesus. Who, would have been a real person, though probably not of any historical import.",

Additionally, if you are correct that the burning of the library portion happened in 48 BC, then nothing about Jesus would likely be included, seeing as he hadn't been born yet. Here's the Wikipedia entry (now I'm getting seriously off-topic because I find this area of the world so fascinating): \"A few sources differ on who is responsible for the destruction and when it occurred. Although there is a mythology of the burning of the Library at Alexandria, the library may have suffered several fires or acts of destruction over many years. Possible occasions for the partial or complete destruction of the Library of Alexandria include a fire set by Julius Caesar in 48 BC, an attack by Aurelian in the AD 270s, and the decree of Coptic Pope Theophilus in AD 391.",

There are a handful of other scholars who are convinced of the same, or similar, things, openly. And, there are those, he says, who are afraid to admit publicly to their beliefs, for fear of ostracism. He recommends the application of Bayesian theory, because the methodologies used by most others is naturally and inherently flawed. Which does seem to be justified and warranted by the fact that while most scholars may find basic agreement in the historicity of Jesus, they tend to disagree on all but two basic tenets, as mentioned here: \"the only two events subject to \"almost universal assent\" are that Jesus was baptized by John the Baptist and was crucified by the order of the Roman Prefect Pontius Pilate.[11][12][13][14]\" SOURCE: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_Jesus It is also noted within the articles that methodologies are highly contested and hotly debated for reliability. I also find it quite compelling that by applying Bayesian theory he has arrived at the same basic conclusions as D.M. Murdock, who has made an astro-theological connection between most religions from the era and region. His conclusions, though not a one to one match, do fit nicely within that framework, while allowing for other mystic interpretations, making it one of those fascinating multi-layered cakes of intrigues. Not only that, but we can see aspects of what he mentions relative to early Christianity, and several other religions of the region and time still present today across various sects of Christianity. Given all of this, it becomes increasingly difficult to wedge in a historical Jesus. However, I will mention something I'd forgotten to mention earlier, in the interest of honesty and integral inquiry. There are many reports that at the proposed time of Jesus, there were lots of people running around calling themselves the messiah of prophecy, and at least one common theory holds that John the Baptist was just such a character. In fact, it is also believed that John was believed by many of that time and place to have been that messiah, instead of Jesus. So, this would go a long ways toward explaining that exchange during the baptism of Jesus. John bowing to Jesus' authority would have lent a strong credibility to the claim that Jesus was the one true son of God, given the common prior belief that John was he. By that, alone, there would almost be credible reason to believe John was a real person, and Jesus was made up, but lent an air of reality by reports of that exchange.",

It is hardly surprising that such a figure would have miracle stories attached to him. The existence of a widespread Christian Movement in the late first century, with congregations throughout the eastern Empire and in Rome. Presupposes an earlier movement from which these descend. Within ten years of Jesus' death Paul is involved in persecuting Christians and no doubt new the history of their movement intimately. If he could have attacked them by saying Jesus never existed he surely would have. After his conversion (still within 10 years of Jesus death), he writes letters in which he describes meeting the new leader's of the movement, Jesus's chief disciple (Peter) and his brother (James). What movement would they be the head of how and how did they get into those positions except int he way Paul describes. If Christianity is something created out of whole cloth by Paul, why would Paul invent Peter and James. James is independently attested in Josephus (Jesus probably is too, in a passage which attracted a later interpolation, but Origen and other sources preserve the original reading which mentions both James and Jesus through quotation--I'm no reporting my opinion, but scholarly consensus). Other than in the vase of a few emperors and leading political figures who are mentioned by historians and who left epigraphic evidence, this is a better attestation for the historicity of Jesus than exists for almost any other of the 50 or so million inhabitants of the Roman Empire in the early first century.",

So, for it not to have any practical basis, Carrier would have had to go back in time and either pretend to be Bayes, himself, or else convince Bayes to theorize this thing that would ultimately be published some time after his death. I think your dismissal sounds a bit far fetched, and over-reaching, given its implications.

Oh ye of narrow mind and limited imagination. Religions are highly complex subjects. Far more complex than that which they are proposed to explain. This is what is meant by the term, \"convoluted.\" Astro-theology is about religions as a pragmatic narrative that aid in celestial navigation of seasons, and geography, for the purposes of travel and crop management. They also serve to fuel the imagination. Bring those celestial bodies into a human incarnation and you have the makings of a mythological legend of epic proportions. One would, of course, need be versed in linguistics, history, archaeological study, theology, multiple languages, and a couple other subjects to begin to make any real progress in such an inquiry. And, of course, an open and questioning mind is essential. What D.M. Murdock has produced with her large, and well sourced body of work explains a lot about comparative religions, and direct one to one cross-overs (i.e. parallels). Put that together with other works that do not find contradiction, and you have yourself the beginnings of a comprehensive study in theology. So, shudder all you shall, little frightened flower, the world is what it is and will not bow to your will. The question is whether or not you are open to consideration, without instant dismissal of all claims which do not immediately support what you already believe.",

In a review of his two volume set, about the Historicity of Jesus, the first book dedicated to introducing the Bayesian method in language approachable by the average non-academic intellect, and the second dedicated to an analysis of what scant and weak evidence there is for the historicity of Jesus, reviewers, including the author of the article, as well as commenters seem to be in basic agreement... Not with you, but with each other. They felt like the Bayesian method was being degraded by being applied to something as controversial as Jesus studies, immediately upon introducing it as the best method for producing historical accuracy. They all agree that the Bayesian method is the best approach, but that it should have been demonstrated by some historical data which was far less controversial, and, in many way, easier to prove via the Bayesian method. Thus building and gaining confidence in the method before tackling such a controversial and emotive issue. I am drawing this from the article and comment section at the following link: http://lesswrong.com/lw/9pm/minireview_proving_history_bayes_theorem_and_the/ I was in search of reasons not to use Bayes theorem as a methodology for proving history. Instead, what I got was why it shouldn't be used relative to the historical Jesus (yet). My search criterion was this: \"problems with applying Bayes theorem to historical research\" , and that article was one of two at the top of the search results, both from the same source/web site. The one at the top of the search results was this one: http://lesswrong.com/lw/774/a_history_of_bayes_theorem/ Which is more of a summary of information contained in another book about Bayes theorem, by a different author. I am now quite confident that Bayes theorem would be extremely useful in analysis of historical data, and even with regard to something as controversial as the historicity of Jesus. Especially since the complaints weren't that it wouldn't work for that, but that doing so early on would tend to raise the ire of a lot of emotional historians who are quite attached to their favorite religious beliefs, causing them to dismiss the theorem as probable... Much as you have done here. I guess they had a point. My suggestion is that if you wish to be taken seriously as an investigator of any kind, you should divorce yourself of your emotional attachments to pet theories.",

The problem with your question is that, in this particular instance, according to any research, analysis, or conclusion I can find on the matter, all agree that the Josephus account/details are forgeries. That he may have briefly mentioned, in passing, a messianic/Christian movement, but that does not necessarily refer to the Jesus stories, as there were many claiming to have been the prophesied Christos (savior). In fact, there are probably more people today who believe they are Christ, or else make that claim, than there were back then, and yet, it was quite common. John the Baptist is one presumed instance of that. Unfortunately for Carrier the prior probability that a movement such as the early Church by Peter and James would be built on a figment of Paul's imagination is zero. I think you are applying some rather polemical and arbitrary numbers. You are saying there is zero chance that people would have built a church based on some fantastical fantasies of some wandering fool. And yet, there are a vast multitude of religions with an awful lot of common features to Christianity that I dare say you would scoff at the idea of them being based on anything other than an illusion. Otherwise, you must accept that Osiris, Mithra, Zeus, Zoarander, and several other gods were also historical characters, and therefore, this world would be far from being one warranted of monotheism. You, perhaps not meaning to, are allowing your biases to show... immodestly, I might add. When I'm ready to know you that intimately I will invite you to the bedroom.",

You mentioned some college level training. I wonder... In all that training, did you ever play the game of telephone? We did in my journalism course, as well as a couple other courses on science, and creative writing, as well as in my drafting class. Had you played that game, and it actually had the impact it should have had, you would be quite disparaged by that fact. That said, even having it in writing doesn't help much since they did not have the technology for making (near) perfect reproductions we have today. It was all hand copied by scribes who were, being human, bound to make mistakes, and some of whom, apparently, allowed their own biases to color how they copied information. Many of them added, changed, and removed things they obviously found \"offensive.\" This, as a Christian, is where faith comes in. It's that little emotional jump you have to take, since all these events took place about 2000 years ago It is no small leap. And, in any case, a leap of faith is a euphemism for a leap of logic.

Nothing (assuming he even existed to be anything at all), he was no less a witch/wizard, which seems to be a term intended to refer to others like himself but who claimed a different force, or God, upon which to call. The terms were certainly use pejoratively, except, of course, in the case of the three Magi (Zoroastrian wizards/wise men), who were supposedly a few days late to witness his birth. It wasn't to systemically brainwash and oppress people; the Catholic church didn't exist until hundreds of years later. I see... So, you presuppose that the catholic church is the only entity either capable, or else guilty of employing indoctrination and brain washing techniques. Call it looking at the glass half full. And, I suppose you would project that my perspective sees the glass as half empty? However, depending on the subject matter, I would sometimes describe it as half full, entirely full, mostly full, almost empty, or entirely empty.

        "commentText": "+Palmela Handerson Equating oral tradition to a game of telephone is just inaccurate. It's identical. Oral tradition IS a game of telephone, in a very literal sense. Oral tradition is not the same as a game in which people intentionally change a message to make it funny. That's not how the game is played. The game is played, for one, to demonstrate that the message does change from person to person, and in some cases the result can be quite hilarious. Each successive person is supposed to relay the information as reliably and accurately as they can. However, because of the ways in which our brains work, everyone invariably hears, or else places emphasis on different parts, and makes various associations which may or may not be relevant to the information being conveyed. What the Hell did you learn at that college anyhow? Think more in terms of Beowulf, composed in the mid 500s AD; it's still pretty much the same today as it was at its inception. Are you fucking kidding me? Hercules... Ever heard the name? He was a Greek demi-god. His real name was actually Herakles. His stories were passed on by oral tradition, and there are a multitude of variations. The same is true of the Beowulf saga. There are many different tellings and interpretations. Not to mention the fact that in some languages just a slight variation in inflection can change the whole meaning. It's even true in the English language. For instance, \"What the fuck!?!?!?!,\" and \"What the fuck.\" Not only that, but given the time frame involved, there is no possible way you could know that the story hadn't changed in drastic ways, building the legend till it was super human in scope and scale. Faith =/= foolishness. I guess it kinda depends on which kind of faith one is talking about. Blind, naive faith is certainly foolish. Faith built on trust earned by experience is not quite as foolish, and sometimes necessary. And, mild blind faith, in facts that are less important is not nearly as foolish as either of the first two. How foolish any form of faith is will depend greatly on the (potential) consequences. That's a huge misconception with Americans these days. I don't know where you're from, but most Americans are devoutly religious, to the point of being absurd in their beliefs. I should know, I live with and among these assholes. Which means that they rely heavily on blind faith, even in matters of life and death importance. So, occasionally, you'll get an American atheist who will overstate the issue of faith being foolish. In all honesty, it isn't always, but the more dire the consequences, the more foolish the faith. People die in traffic accidents, but it takes some level of faith in the general public and in your own driving abilities that that's not going to happen. That is a level of faith based on trust earned by experience. It is neither blind, nor naive faith. Faith in religious dogma is naive when little or no evidence is present, and blind when it runs contrary to evidence. Religious dogma holds dire consequences, no matter ones perspective. Thus, blind and naive faith as applied to religion is ALWAYS foolish. Without faith, you're left to live in your fears. Even with faith one can live in fear. For instance, in my Christian youth, I lived in perpetual fear that demons and monsters may get me while God is attending to some other, more deserving, Christian. I lived in perpetual fear of death, and the consequences of my life... Would I go to Heaven or Hell. I was quite convinced I was headed for Hell, because, despite my best wishes, I could not stop myself from feeling compelled to lie to my parents. That is, till I developed convenient amnesia. I personally have faith that early Christians did not simply have some hidden agenda to create the biggest conspiracy in human history, and there's sufficient evidence to back that belief (stated partially in my previous posts). I, personally, have sufficient reason to believe that all methodologies applied to the historicity of biblical text is fallacious, misleading, and unreliable. The reason I believe this is that it is made quite obvious in the huge disparity among biblical scholars who can only agree on two basic things, it seems... That Jesus was baptized by John the Baptist, and that he was later ordered to be crucified by Pontius Pilate.",

There are minor variations here and there, but then there's always those one or two people who laugh, and say they heard something drastically different from what they were told. Telephone is a GAME one plays in elementary school. People don't take it seriously. Oral tradition is part of a person's culture, part of who they are. And as atheists so obnoxiously point out, culture is something people start wars over. Unfounded faith in any aspect IS foolish - the Bible even says to \"not test the Lord your God,\" and illustrates the meaning by Satan suggesting that Jesus jump off a cliff. It means, \"don't do something you know is stupid and expect God to save you.\" Faith, however, is when you don't have every answer, but you have a good idea of something, and act as if it were true. Foolishness is acting a certain way against the evidence. Day-to-day life requires some level of faith (in various forms). Period. Agree with me or not, if you disagree, you're wrong. Period. End of discussion. America has become progressively more atheist. In the past 10 years, you see the media saying more and more about religious extremism by Islam and the Westboro Baptist Church, but it's frowned upon when anyone mentions Jesus as a source of strength or inspiration. Eyes roll and reporters smile condescendingly. As for the consistency in Mark, Matthew, and Luke, all I can say is, read them - there are many more similarities than differences. One thing Bible critics do is point out what they claim to be contradictions in the Bible between things which are not mutually exclusive. For example, if I said that, during my summer vacation, I went to the beach and I later tell someone else that on my summer vacation, I climbed a mountain, I didn't lie; I could have gone to Hawaii for my summer vacation, and done both of those things! In the Bible, people will point to what Jesus said on the cross, and claim it's contradictory....He was up on the cross for hours there, people. He died a slow, agonizing death. Is it really that crazy to think that he said a bunch of things on that cross? If you use your motherfucking head, placed between your motherfucking shoulders, it's really not that complicated. Besides, the sole purpose of the Nicene Councils was to eliminate heretical (untrue) books that began to pop up about Jesus, because early Christians understood the importance of ensuring the integrity of the works. People didn't travel hundreds or thousands of miles to meet somewhere just because they felt like it, because they thought it would be fun, or whatever. They did it because they thought that humanity had just witnessed one of the most important events in its history, and they wanted to paint the most accurate and complete portrait of Jesus without including anything that didn't really happen (the Gnostic Christians, among others, had begun to warp who Jesus was). So, do I trust the dozens of church members committed to the cause of preserving the memory of Jesus Christ, or do I trust the minority of doubters 2,000 years removed from the events in question? I'll take the former. That's where my faith comes in. As evolution would tell us, people are still the same old chimps we were 2,000 years ago - we just have different tools. Don't let em go to your head. Oh and, Lil Kim, you worthless piece of shit, I'm a certified genius (that's IQ 140+ if you didn't know) and the youngest person in my school's history to enter the gifted program. I'm also 25, have a college degree, my father is a self-made millionaire, I have multiple financial licenses since I graduated from college, including my series 65, and I'm testing this June to join the ranks of those few 1000s of people in the world with their CFA. So fuck yourself and go back to working at Hungry Howies, or whatever worthless shithole you work in. I own your boss.",

That and about $1.83 will get you a cup of coffee almost anywhere but Starbucks. Mine, by the way, somewhere around 168. It is basically meaningless, and useless unless one applies it. Also, there are many different skill types that can qualify a person for a high I.Q. Mine is referred to as 'visual linguist.' But, having a high I.Q. does not default to any greater intellect or personal worth. So, climb down from your high horse Miss Priss. I own your boss. Congratulations... You just made all of those I.Q. points entirely meaningless in your case. Unfounded faith in any aspect IS foolish Yeah? No shit? Well, that's what we've been trying to tell you. Bible even says to \"not test the Lord your God,\" To not question/test your GOD in any way entails unfounded faith. Believing in the independent existence of a GOD, as defined/depicted in the Bible IS unfounded faith. Jumping off a cliff, expecting the LORD to save your dumb ass is doubly foolish, because one is doing a foolish thing, for a foolish reason. An action that can only be driven by the primary foolish act of unfounded faith in belief. And as atheists so obnoxiously point out, culture is something people start wars over. Yeah, I'll admit that atheists are obnoxiously right about that one. Let us not forget that religion or else the lack of it, is a pivotal aspect of most cultures. The ones that start wars most often? The most religious ones, of course. And the ones who most often abstain from active warfare? The most atheistic ones. We are obnoxious about pointing that one out too. Unfortunately for your position we are also obnoxiously right about it. Day-to-day life requires some level of faith (in various forms). Period. Agree with me or not, if you disagree, you're wrong. Period. End of discussion. Meh, Okay.",

And, even that date is being extremely generous since the earliest possible date for any of the gospel accounts is several decades (at least 40 years or somewhere around or after 70 A.D./C.E) after Christ is said to have been crucified. Which means that the gospel authors could not possibly have known him. The epistles of Paul are believed to have been older... having been written within 20 (as early as 40 A.D./C.E) years after his supposed death. However, Paul never actually speaks about Christ as an earthly being who he actually met in the flesh. In fact, he describes his encounters as being ethereal, and hallucinatory. So, even the earliest possible \"eyewitness\" doesn't actually claim to be an eyewitness.",

Just look at how you're reacting. Now go and read my original comments in context. BTW: Did you know that the first digital computer was built in the 1820s to control a steam loom. It was built by Charles Babbage. (An ENGLISH mathematician). When IBM went to use punch cards (cards with holes) to control Univac in the 1940s, they had to pay a license fee to the Babbage family to use the technology. The concept of the modern computer was proposed by Alan Turing (British) in 1936. During WW2 Turing developed the \"Bombe\" an electromechanical device used to decrypt the Enigma-machine. Just think without the Brits, probably no computers and no internet. In reality of course someone would have developed them (and the internet) eventually.",

    "commentText": "It is important not to attempt to pronounce a name of God. See, Malachi 4:2, kjv. Also, see Exodus 34:14, kjv. (Love and jealousy go together. Envy, is about hate. \"She got the promotion - me so envious\" versus, \"She's leaving - broken heart - jealous for her\"). Not everybody knows this. Now, God is in Christ, and it is written, \"all the fulness of the godhead dwells in him bodily\". Wherefore, the safe way to call upon the name of the Lord is to acknowledge the Son. It is written that God has made his son Jesus both Lord and Christ. Christ is the Word made flesh. Jesus Christ is Lord. See, Exodus 23 :20-22 ; Matthew 7 :24-27, kjv... \"Upon A rock\", as opposed to \"upon THE sand\" - wherefore, seek a specific rock. This, Saving Christmas, is an interesting looking movie. Curious to see (hear) his argument to reconcile the commercial aspects of Christmas with theological truths. I suppose one could see Santa as a cautionary tale. What happens when a man is no longer useful, able to make things in a workshop? Will magic elves help him keep deadlines? Will he work for food - milk and cookies even? (Art is open to subjective interpretation : I still see \"the Samta meme\" as propaganda promoting what Noam Chomsky has called, \"an irrational attitude of submission towards authority\".) Usury, (\"using\" others - looking upon them as a \"resource\") is bad. Making the elderly feel valued, is good. Umm, some though might argue that being used is a great feeling - to be Superman, rather than Clark. Santa, as superhero? Umm, he's more like a bartender. The Christmas Tree. What fruit does it bare? The money tree - Do not confuse the love OF money, with the love FOR money. \"What can I get with this nickel?\" versus, \"I need another dollar to legally obtain..\" How well do you know a loved one? \"Wow, power tools, because I'm a dad, right? Question - have you ever seen me fix anything? Do I look like Jennie Garth?\" Well, it is the feeling, rather than the thinking, that counts, right? A tree, perchance, a Cross. It is written, Cursed is he who hangs on a tree. But what does that mean, to \"hang on\" a tree? Idolatry? If you focus, stare at a tree, are you \"hanging\" on it? 3d vision? Should you see the forest rather, as if looking at a 2d painting? Men, how like trees, moving about? Women, how like birds, looking for a branch, a place of rest? Moses, once made a brass serpent, and hung it about a pole, and lifted it up- like a string of popcorn around a tree, reaching up towards a focal point, a star.. The law of Moses, like the flesh, is passing, but the spirit remains, does it not? : Focus not on things which are temporal, but upon things which are eternal. See, Philippians 4:8, kjv. The Christmas Tree - art is open to subjective interpretation. Water is considered a necessity, and is associated with sobriety. In contrast, wine is considered a luxury, and is associated with drunkeness. Art, music, rituals, dances, how like wine? Meditating upon holy writ, how like water - necessary?: Very. To put Christ first, desire sobriety. Advice : Ignore \"holidays\": Should not, for Believers, every day, be a holy day? Every year, there are days, and seasons wherein drunkeness is encouraged. Well, I suppose there is a time to plant, and a time to harvest, to celebrate.. Footloose (Kevin Bacon)? But I think oft upon how many feel oppressed, and not liberated, wherefore celebration \"seemeth wickedness\" to me - \"bah hum bug\", I suppose, you will hear. A Christmas Carol, by Charles Dickens, the book and the movie (pick one), how like propaganda? : If you buy others turkey dinners, they will like you - No, they will think you are running for public office. Stay in \"logic-space\", and be ye not, \"emotionally compromised\" : Stay Real. This movie should do well in dvd sales. I still like, The Greatest Story Ever Told, though I do not watch it now that I study the Bible, for it seems not wise to mix water with wine. Holiday Wishes, starring Amber Benson, is pretty good. It's A Wonderful Life - disturbing, because of the noticeable absence of \"the black man\" : \"Missuh Bailey, when I heards about your money woes, I cames a running. I know if I lost white folks' money, they'd be getting them some rope. Now I don't have much, but what I gots, is yours - let's see, two buttons, a spool of thread, and a dime\"... Now, now, get out of here, you clown.. that's not going to cover the deposit.. Oh wait, I better take the dime.. Always remember the sufferings of Job, and how his friends berated him for not admitting fault, when they could have given him a present instead, with fancy giftwrap, to cheer him up. A Gameboy, to forget his sorrows with, perchance. Or, is it, \"cyber-suicide\"?",

    "commentText": "To dispossess - of false notions? of stuff? Of IT? To dispossess - to convert? to recover? \"You were always a Jew - temporary amnesia\".. See, Judges 11 : 23-24, kjv. If the LORD decides to destroy a people, \"the inhabitants of the land\", He will. (Sodom and Gomorah come to mind. Was Lot an inhabitant of Sodom, or did he merely dwell there? What makes one an inhabitant, as opposed to a stranger?) He has not given Israel, to my knowledge, a \"standing order\", from generation unto generation to \"hunt down\" and destroy \"the wicked\", and pursue an expansionary \"land grab\" policy. Yet, land and people are oft mentioned together, as if land is important. It does make sense to say that the earth has been given to the godly to possess it, though the wicked \"control\" the land, by means of guns, requiring taxes (tribute) to be paid. Why does the LORD permit the wicked to prosper, for the innocent to be persecuted. The story of Job, is never far from my mind. I guess life is a test, and the test is, Do you yet believe in love, though what happens in life would have you believe otherwise? The TV show, Dome, comes to mind. Is that not a similitude of Israel? - shut off from the world, and charged with the task of creating a perfect society, free of usury (looking upon others as a resource - to use them), until such time \"the egg\" might hatch, and the Dome, come down? Christians believe that the egg has hatched. Which makes it perplexing that soo many who call themselves Christian, should advocate, Policy Z? What good can come of it? Or is Judeo-Palestine not in conflict with the Law of Moses? They who walk after the flesh, are under the Law. Whereas they who walk after the Spirit are under Grace. For example, if you regard food as medicine (the flesh is weak, though the spirit is willing), then kosher dietary laws do not apply. Or would an Orthodox Jew refuse a tylenol capsule, if it was coated in gelatin? The land of Canaan. Labels help justify murder, theft of property, etc. And so many preachers, and pastors, liken men to dirt, dung even, rather than to trees. They claim, \"black men\" are \"canaanites\", and \"canaanites\" are to be used as slaves, or destroyed. And their land taken. This explains acts of evil such as \"Wounded Knee\" - so-called, because ostensibly they would have you care more for a soldier who falls off of his horse, than for the persons who were murdered there. Blacks, Indians, Arabs, Mexicans - they do not call such Christians, for that might make it difficult to kill them, enslave them, or steal from them. Noah did NOT curse Canaan, but said yhat Canaan was cursED. Nor did he say that the brothers of Canaan were cursed. It seems obvious then that his brothers were as their father Ham - wicked. Wherefore as a social worker might, Noah removed Canaan from the household of Ham, and said he would be a servant of Shem, and also of Japheth, (and servant does NOT mean slave - a slave is as a tool, unable to disobey). Jesus said that a servant does not remain in the house forever, but the son abides forever. Noah gave Canaan a hope of adoption, while distancing him from the household of Ham - his brothers would not be able to distinguish Canaan from other servants. Of, means, from, or, belonging to. A rabbit of rabbits, is what a magician might pull out of a hat - one of many. But now they who wish to promote slavery, eugenics, etc., preach a different gospel - perverting the words of the Living God to create their \"social utopia\", paving the way for antichrist. If Crazy Horse, or Osama Bin Laden, believED.. See, Galations 3:29, kjv.",

You have to begin somewhere. On the other hand, there is a darkness to \"christmas\" - rearrange the letters, SANTA, to get SATAN... Is that not mind-control technology? Eh kids, trust the \"white male authority figure\" - eugenics, the Crusades, the belief that genetics determines holiness, rather than behaviour - wherefore, kill, or enslave the \"coloured man\", violate (breed with) the coloured women, until all have white fathers - to get, to the \"promised land\". Is that not what \"Wounded Knee\" was about? Showing more concern for a nazi who falls off of his horse, while exterminating the \"natives\", to take their land - \"dispossess them\" at the point of a gun? Is that not \"the gospel\" they have preached for thousands of years, to the illiterate and carnally-minded, who desire \"earthly rewards\"? Is that not their \"prosperity\", rather than wisdom, knowledge, and understanding?... He gave them the land - that is to say, to the godly, and said to them who sought holiness, that they shall (not shalt) possess the land... Jesus said, If ye believed in Moses, ye would have believed me, for Moses wrote of me... And so, Jews who hear Moses, come to Christ. And Christians hear Moses - how you are under the Law if you walk after the flesh... A Jew is a Christian, and a Christian is a Jew.... Well, I suppose I could fill up \"textbooks\" with my writing - but would such get published? I doubt it. Jesus said, Seek and ye shall find... Others might seek, but will not find, but to whom it is given to find... such should seek.",

It would be relegated to the likes of hanukkah as some dumb thing religious people do because of reasons. Same thing with Easter. No one would give a SHIT about Easter if it weren't for candy and the Easter bunny (which is why it's a holiday marketed almost universally to children).",

Christians ought to have nothing to do with Pagan holidays. If you want to celebrate Jesus' birth, don't do it on the winter solstice when all the Pagans worship the birth of the Greek god, Tammuz. Maybe you could actually DO IT AROUND THE TIME OF JESUS' BIRTH! It's like the \"Christians\" celebrating Halloween, another one of Satan's holidays.",

How can you put Christ back into Christmas when he was never there to begin with. Do your homework. Yeshua the Messiah was not born in December, the whole baby in the manger story has gone way to far. He wasn't even a baby when the wise men arrived. I pray that people stop believing what they are told is truth, and research themselves. The bible is clear we are to obey YaHoVahs commands. Not celebrating pagan holidays is on that list, and celebrating the feasts that Yeshua celebrated is. Why would you want to worship pagan gods in the name of Jesus, unless you don't know yet that Jesus is a pagan name. Truth: Mary did not name her son Jesus.....She named him Yeshua as she was instructed by the angel. So, if you celebrate and worship the pagan Jesus, I wonder how father feels about that, I can tell you it breaks His heart. He is grieving that His children have believed lies and continue to walk in deception, thinking they know the truth, but really they don't. I pray for revelation and real Holy Spirit conviction.",

It's about keeping God's feast days that He commanded for all generations. Yeshua (Jesus) was the Word (Torah) made flesh....he was the living Torah, WHY keep the man made tradition holiday just because it's fun and we want it to mean what we say it does as a reason....and not keep His feast days? I am so much more free, more alive knowing the Truth and keeping His ways and commands. Wake Up People! Go research for yourself the truth behind Christmas and Easter and the Truth about His Torah!

The merchants of the world depend more on this holiday, to fill in their profits, than all the rest of the year. If the masses of the world were to realize the truth about christmas, the drive to blow wads of cash, would dwindle. And as they should. Kirk Cameron is not so much saving a holiday that was hodge podged from various pagan customs, as he is trying to get the spending drive going again. The merchants have hired him as their spokesman, their pitchman, their panhandler. No one should be ashamed of shedding old traditions, once they have learned that those traditions don't represent the One they thought they worshiped. Yahovah, the Creator of all that is, is NOT in need of any representation made by the hands of man. All that is around us, the Earth, the stars above, and all natural things, are His representatives already. Only man has fell from that order, to follow his own traditions, rather than truth.",

That's all a tree like that is. Christians put up pagan idols all the time, the 'Christmas' tree among them. And it amuses me every year when they fight over the right to these pagan symbols and act as if various pagan holidays rightfully belongs to them when they belong to humanity as a whole. You break any of your religious laws you want when it's something you like and condemn others for doing the same when it's something you don't like. It's sadly typical for those in the Abrahamic religions.",

        "commentText": "+sumotaby Pagan symbols and holidays were threaded in to Christian life because the early Church used the old Roman technique of convincing the people they wished to conquer that they shared a religion. The Romans would find a god similar to one of their own, claim it was the same, and slowly the smaller religions and traditions were absorbed and assimilated into the Roman Empire. The early Catholic church just followed the formula of adopting the holidays and changing the gods. Half the early Saints in Catholicism were just gods turned into people. Pagan religious sites had churches plopped on top of them for the same reason. The only sheep I see here is the one who thinks one book holds all the answers. And even then you cherry pick for whatever fits your desires. Enjoy your pagan evergreen idol wrapped in lights this year. I know I will be enjoying mine. )O(",

Why did you tell me to pull my head out of my butt and stop being a sheep about what people 'tell' me? That doesn't really make sense, I would almost assume you would agree with me on the pagan meaning. I'm also not Christian. I'm Neo-Pagan. The ')O(' symbol is the triple goddess symbol. It represents the waxing, full and waning moon, the maiden, mother and crone forms of the goddess. I'm more than happy to put up a Yule tree to remind me of the rebirth of the sun and the rebirth of the god. My judment is against Christians who act like these clearly pagan symbols and holidays belong to them, only them, forever and always, with no regard to the origins and uses of them. +Mootube1980 Then do us all a favor and remind your fellow Christians they don't own December and that yes, there are other holidays during that time of year. Including the one early Christians hijacked to create the mismatched story of how and when Jesus was born. Which, according to the bible, was in lambing season.. which was never around the Winter Solstice. And certainly wasn't part of Joseph returning to Bethlehem because of a survey. That's, one, not how population surveys work, not even back then, and two, there's no record of one being performed during the proposed time frame. All these little facts sure do add up to something interesting, don't you think? I think, also, your god has a lot to say about what is good practice and bad practice. His usual answer in the mythology is to kill those who don't follow his law to the letter. Just sayin'.",

She wrapped him in cloths and placed him in a manger, because there was no guest room available for them. 8 And there were shepherds living out in the fields nearby, keeping watch over their flocks at night. 9 An angel of the Lord appeared to them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were terrified. 10 But the angel said to them, “Do not be afraid. I bring you good news that will cause great joy for all the people. 11 Today in the town of David a Savior has been born to you; he is the Messiah, the Lord. 12 This will be a sign to you: You will find a baby wrapped in cloths and lying in a manger.” 13 Suddenly a great company of the heavenly host appeared with the angel, praising God and saying, 14 “Glory to God in the highest heaven, and on earth peace to those on whom his favor rests.” 15 When the angels had left them and gone into heaven, the shepherds said to one another, “Let’s go to Bethlehem and see this thing that has happened, which the Lord has told us about.” 16 So they hurried off and found Mary and Joseph, and the baby, who was lying in the manger. 17 When they had seen him, they spread the word concerning what had been told them about this child, 18 and all who heard it were amazed at what the shepherds said to them. 19 But Mary treasured up all these things and pondered them in her heart. 20 The shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all the things they had heard and seen, which were just as they had been told.",

While yes many large religions are offshoot tales based on Jesus, Jesus is the only one of all dieties to actually prove His existence and perform actual miracles. An example of and offshoot is Islam. They believe that Jesus' Father (God) sent Mohammed who is the Comforter in their minds. They quote the Bible for this. Jesus said He was going to leave so His Father can send the Comforter, which is actually the Holy Ghost. They do two things, commit the unforgivable sin of blaspheming the Holy Ghost by saying it is not the Comforter and they also confirm that Jesus is God/the Son of God. (Jesus+God+Holy Ghost=the Trinity) God is very real, Jesus really existed and performed the miracles told to us in the Bible, and Creation did happen.

Christians are among the most pathetic religious people because they don't even study their own religion, they go based on random preachers' interpretations of it, which are about as accurate as the original interpretations as they're complete bullshit and whatever the preacher is feeling at the time. If God created science, the bible could explain a single thing in modern science. The bible couldn't even get the anatomical number of ribs from a man right (If Eve was made from Adam's rib, shouldn't men have one less rib?) The bible doesn't explain anything in math, science or logic, it doesn't comprehend the notion of evolutionary biology and every single facet of it that shapes our modern understanding of medicine (The medicine you probably use or would use if you were dying instead of prayer) The bible was written from iron age peasants' interpretation of things they believed were true. It still confounds and amazes me that religious people will ignore obvious truth, i.e. actual self evident truth in order to hold onto a lie that comforts them. Because when you step back and look at the big picture the lie is less comforting and more disturbing. Especially because religion is probably the true source of injustice in the world.",

I went one by one and after about 2/3 of them being nothing more two explanations in two different places I realized the whole load of BS anti-God people were trying to present. An example (these numbers are random as I do not remember the exact details at the moment): A purchase was made and he paid for a house for 23 gold. Later when talking about this same event the Bible says he paid 50 gold for the whole property. CONTRADICTION! No, the first is how much he bought the house for, the second is how much he bought the property for. I'm pretty sure this \"contradiction\" is in Daniel. The Bible isn't full of crap, nor is it based on other mythologies. When the Nephalim fell from Heaven, who knows what evil they brought upon the earth before the flood that was told in stories long after. I think there were a group of giants or something that were self-proclaimed \"gods\" before the flood and they survived in tale from the stories told by the descendants of Noah. Men of incredible strength lived back then, like Goliath and Samson. So it is easily possible of thinking there was a man named Hercules running around performing incredible feats. Try thinking about everything as being possibly real only not so \"mythological\". The Bible is true, the stories in it are true. All other mythology came from somewhere and as stories become legends the heroes grow stronger and stronger.",

When statements like you made are said, intelligence is clearly a factor.

He actually allowed Himself the be sacrificed, then raised from the dead. Its not if but when He did those things. How can one say that faith in mortal men who cant create a grain of sand from nothing \"know\" all life evolved from blobs, \"know\" what crushed piles of bones were in this chain of evolution, all while the radioactive decay in carbon dating only became this constant at 6000 years ago. All the while it is rationalized that all humans across the globe evolved at the exact same rate, no creature has ever evolved in recorded history, and all forms of life work the exact same way. (Circulatory system, nervous system, etc) If a man stood before you who was just executed on a cross 3 days prior, with the giant nail holes in his limbs and was lifted by a cloud to Heaven, how would you explain that other than just how it happened? Not only is God real, I know when He is trying to get me to understand something, I have seen how He made things happen that seemed impossible, and the story of my life alone is nothing less than perfectly guided.

Life is not fair and bad things often happen to good people, but that's why God gives us the promise of hope in a world where people will be judged based on their actions. But that's not what I really wanted to say. I wanted to say that Andrew was wrong when he said there was a purpose to your suffering. That paints a harsh and untrue picture of God. Many people live under the false impression that God is the ruler of the Earth, but He is not. Satan, the father of all lies, is the ruler of the Earth. God will someday (as listed in Revelations) come back to the world in the form of Jesus and establish His Kingdom here, but that is not right now. Satan has complete freedom of the Earth, and so it is not God's purpose for you to suffer. He does not make people suffer, that is Satan. However, God can bring something beautiful out of that suffering...and I hope that that will eventually happen for you. I just did not want you to keep living under the impression (if you are, or because of what Andrew had said) that it is God's purpose to have some people to suffer for His glory or to make them learn something, because it is not. He is good. He is just. He is loving.",

He gave them and told them what to include. People talked to him in those days. They wrote down on what is called \"scrolls\". The Bible is a compilation of these \"scrolls\" to put together what we have today. Dead Sea Scrolls were found in a cave some decades ago. If you look they hold many portions mentioning people from the Old Testament. Sarah, Isaac, etc. Yes God is as real today as he was then. Read the Book of Revelation. Everything happening today is in that book. The world will bow down to our Lord and EVERY KNEE SHALL BOW EVERY TONGUE CONFESS THAT JESUS IS LORD. Sorry to disappoint so many, but that is how it goes.

It is only going to appeal to fundamental Christians, and atheists who want to see how bad it's going to be. Just because someone is a Christian, doesn't mean they're going to want to watch this type of movie. Basically every movie like this just insults anyone who isn't a Christian. Let's compare this to another movie that's coming out this season, \"The Hobbit\". \"The Hobbit\" has magic, and intense battles between good and evil, and dragons, and adventure, and so much more. It appeals to a wide variety of people, of various faiths and beliefs. This has a bunch of people whining about how people don't believe the same thing as them. If you gathered a hundred people at a movie theater, how many of them would pick this?",

Your story never changes. You don't have any evidence against the theory of evolution. Jesus never even existed and there is not one piece of evidence to back you up, only scripture from the bible which is all hearsay.",

They used to release them as blockbusters back in Hollywood's hey day. The Ten Commandments? Ben Hur? The Robe? All blockbusters from the old days. In recent years, Passion of the Christ was very powerful (and also a blockbuster). More recently: The Bible (History Channel series) was excellently done, where Son of God was brought to the theater (taken from The Bible). Both were hits. The latest two hits were God is Not Dead and Heaven is for Real. They were both done very well. Kirk Cameron, unfortunately, produces very cheesy films. I've watched a couple of them and they're actually pretty embarrassing. After getting through them, you want to say \"that wasn't so bad,\" but you end up saying \"why the hell do they make these things so damn cheesy?\" Whoever produced God is Not Dead and Heaven is for Real, however, were on the right track. Less cheese, less in your face messaging - just a good wholesome movie about the impact of Christianity. I find it funny, though, that atheists have decided to capitalize on Judeo-Christian themed movies. First, it was Noah... then Unbroken, and now Exodus. I guess they don't hate religion enough to cease capitalizing on them.",

If you would learn to read scripture from a Hebraic perspective, it's pretty clear. Where christmas occurs on December 25th every year on a Gregorian calendar. The date of Jesus birth would be on the same date every year on the Jewish calendar. But most christians will not take the effort to learn the difference in dates. You'll need to learn about the Hebraic Festival dates and especially the significance of these dates. They are referred to in scripture as the \"Appointed Times\". When you learn these dates, you'll clearly see the exact dates. Hint, learn about \"booths\" and Sukkot in the fall festival dates. Many christians don't like to read scripture from a Hebraic perspective. But suffice to say, Jesus (Yeshua which means Salvation (the name given to Joseph by the angel)) was a Jew. So to really understand how and why He did certain things and said certain things you will have to learn to read scripture from a Hebraic perspective. If not.... you have christmas.",

Father YAH has a calendar for us to celebrate....He has a specific way he wants and expects us to worship him. I PROMISE you that if you start doing BIBLE things BIBLE ways, you WILL be so BLESSED. So much will make sense. Start with being obedient to the 4th commandment. And then the feasts and festivals. Yom Teruah is coming up soon. Find out what that means regarding Yeshua return. Find out about the Spring and summer Feasts and how they have already been fulfilled in YESHUA. Then find out about the Fall Feasts and how they relate to YESHUA'S RETURN. BTW, they ARE NOT JEWISH HOLIDAYS. They are FATHER'S HOLY DAYS!!! It is your RESPONSIBILITY to do the research and dig for the answers. Stop following man's ways and follow Yah's ways. Watch the movie \" LET THE LION ROAR\". Look them up on YouTube. Also listen to Pastor Mark Biltz explain about the appointed times and about the blood moons. Watch 119 Ministries \"LOST SHEEP\"videos and Zachary Bauer. Watch \"Truth or Tradition\" and \"Identity Crisis\" by Jim Staley. TO HIM WHO HAS EARS TO HEAR....SHALOM MISHPACHAH!!!! ♡♡♡ P.S.

He was born on the same date on the Jewish calendar which is just about a different date on a Gregorian calendar which is why christians don't have a clue so they stay with December 25. It is believed He was born during the Fall Festival During Rosh Hashanah and most likely the day of \"Feast of the Trumpets\". This year beginning September 25th. This had to be because the shepherds saw Him during the Feast of Tabernacles \"Sukkhot\" occuring this year from October 9th - 16th. Also known as the Festival of Booths. This is when Jews will make a temporary shelter and live in it that has a roof that is open under the sky. Since most christians have no idea what these festivals mean, why they are celebrated, and when they occur, it's highly understandable why the settle for December 25th. And the worst part of this is, christian churches that are supposed to teach the truth about Yeshua will continue to KNOWINGLY teach lies to their congregations. I say to you, don't take my word for this info. Do you're own diligent research. You might just be amazed.",

If you understand how to read that, understand the Festival dates, and how to interpret them in scripture, it will tell you the probable day(s). Hint, it's no where December 25 and is coming up very soon. As a side note (bursting bubbles here too) He wasn't born in a building, but he was in a stable though not one like you'd think, and placed in a manger there. He was found by the shepherds outside and under the stars. He wasn't born in the location Christians visit in Bethlehem. Here's a big hint, He was born in the same location as King David (which is also told in the scriptures). This is all spelled out right in scripture. But you won't be taught this in any typical christian church. You'll have to learn how to read scripture from a Hebraic perspective.",

Second, If the Bible is a historical account, archeology and independent historical records would verify much of it. But there isn't one single Biblical event that has been verified. Not one. Yet quite a bit of the record disproves it. A huge portion of the validity of the Old Testament rests on the Hebrews being a slave race in Egypt. The Egyptians were extensive record keepers. They were equal opportunity enslavers. The Hebrews just lived there. The pyramids were built by paid labor. The worker villages have been excavated and it was pretty clear they lived a middle class lifestyle. The best scientific evidence against the historical accuracy of the bible? Irrefutable DNA evidence that there were NEVER only two humans alive at any point in time. And likewise, there is zero support for a simultaneous genetic bottleneck of all animal species, including humans, about 4,000 years ago due to being restricted to a single wooden boat. Israeli archaeologists uncovered the 8,000-year-old remains of a prehistoric structure nestled away in the upscale neighborhood of Ramat Aviv. The cornerstone of the ancient building, which lies on a construction site for exclusive apartments, long precedes the time of Abraham and the rest of the Bible’s figures. This 8,000-year-old discovery shows that there were humans in Israel two thousand years before the world was created, according to many Bible literalists! And this find is not alone in its antiquity: The city of Jericho’s foundation is millennia older, and very ancient remains of human culture dating tens of thousands of years ago have also been found in Israel. By comparison, the Bible and its portrayals constitute much later human artifacts and innovations.",

A man named Jesus might have lived at that time in that area, but he's not the one being mentioned in the bible. There are no other recordings about Jesus until 200 years after he suposedly lived. Back then they weren't very good at recording history like we can today, so the only logical assumption to make is that Jesus is a myth along side Hercules, Zeus, Thor, Odin, Vishnu, Kali, Ra, Osiris (being the first incarnation of Jesus according to history and documents) etc. It is easy to dismis all of this because it doesn't fit into your personalized little univers, but facts are facts and faith is the same as fiction. If we started to value faith above facts, you would have to take my word for it, have faith in me when I said that I was the king of Scotland. Like I said, Faith dictates it. If your retort is that it is highly unlikely or that I am mad, well.. Then read the bible once more because it has extremely far fetched claims, just like any religious myth you can find in the world. Unless all religions are true?",

        "commentText": "+Sequoia Foster ah so you're ignorant then. See most atheists usually come from a religious back ground. It also seems that on the bible matter atheists tend to have way more knowledge than the chrisitans because christians tend to just follow their priests blindly without a clue, whereas atheists are looking for stuff in the bible that is incoherent and contradictive because we actually want answers and the truth. I personally cannot settle with half truths or guesses. It's funny you write; \"I won't listen to arrogant people arguing against scriptures they haven't even read.\" yet your monotheistic viewpoint does exactly that when you're deeming all other religions to be false. But I would expect nothing less of ignorance and contradictions from a theist. You spun your whole religion from other older religions and claim it to be unique. I've been there, I've seen how delusional people get with this monotheistic religion. I was asked to be a youthminister going around the country urging other kids to believe in Jesus and God. How could I ever do that when I myself had so many questions and all I got in return was avoidance and passages from the bible that had nothing to do with anything and contradicted another pat of the bible just to raise even more questions. Classical line; It's because God wanted it to be so. Easiest and cheesiest explanation ever. In other words; I don't know, but I'll settle for this. Monotheism = Masochists that want to be oppressed by an unknown entity. The only ones winning inside monotheistic religions are the priests because they hold all the power over their 'flock'",

Even the most painfully pathetic movie is something we'd indulge in, simply because it throws greater films into context, and gives us a new standard of low. This movie is the living definition of a turd. Being religious or not has nothing to do with it. It is objectively terrible from any perspective of judgment.",

Most people in America that claim they are Christians only go to church for holidays like Christmas or Easter (which is kind of ironic since those holidays, mainly Christmas, were pagan holidays) and rarely follow what is said in the Bible if they read it all. If you asked people if they went to church regularly and read the Bible often rather than if they considered themselves a christian, the number would be a lot lower. America has actually been turning away from Christianity. I do think this movie is a huge joke though...",

Christmas is about Jesus! I don't wanna say Happy Holidays! I want everyone else to celebrate Christmas MY way!\" First of all, we encourage people to say Happy Holidays instead of Merry Christmas because guess what... not everyone celebrates Christmas! There are numerous holidays that are celebrated during the Winter Solstice that get forgotten because Christmas has pretty much taken over the holiday season. While I understand and appreciate the sentiment of someone saying \"Merry Christmas,\" I think it's better to be all-inclusive when celebrating the holidays. Don't just assume everyone is celebrating Christmas. Second, if anything has been hijacked, it's the various celebrations that take place on/near the Winter Solstice that people like Kirk Cameron feel completely entitled to because of Christian privilege. Let people celebrate Christmas however the hell they want to. If you don't like it, too bad. Feel free to celebrate Christmas with Jesus and all the other Christian traditions. No one is stopping you! But please, if other people are happier and more comfortable celebrating Christmas with Santa Claus, Christmas trees, eggnog, and not Jesus, LET THEM. This is a secular country, so stop trying to force your religion on everyone else by making them celebrate Christmas the way you want them to. Bottom line: nobody \"needs\" Christ to celebrate Christmas and Christmas has not been \"hijacked.\"",

However, I do kind of disagree about the \"Happy Holidays\" thing. Why should I not be allowed to say \"Merry Christmas?\" I'm totally find if I get back, \"Happy Hanukkah\" or \"Happy Holidays,\" but I don't think it's fair that I should have to worry about offending people for saying \"Merry Christmas.\" It shouldn't be offending. I'm not Jewish and Hanukkah is not offending to me....it's just that person's religion and they should be allowed to express their wishes for me to have a happy holiday in their own way. It's a little upsetting that saying \"Merry Christmas\" has been banned in some places because people can be tolerant of other religions, but Christianity has to be the first to go (not in all cases, but in many).",

Overall atheist are angry and want nothing to do with God or christmas and try to change christmas into a secular holiday which is a way of oppressing religious people into atheism and they hate being surrounded in an atmosphere of jesus. Atheist are mainly biased and will never attack any other holiday but christmas because christ is in it and people will only hate on the true God , not buddha or allah or any of the other Gods because only jesus convicts atheist's hearts.",
