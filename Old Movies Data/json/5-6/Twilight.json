Jacob isn't and tries to stop them with the Cullens. Then Bella gives birth to her child. She survives and turns in to a vampire. That last thing is obvious because this is part 1 so there needs to be a part 2. I will be strange if the main character dies before the series end. And that vampire thing; Edward promised Bella to turn her",

Third, the movies and the books are f*cking horrible excuse me, but it true. I feel sorry for your poor knowledge. You obviously don't know between good books and bad books. It's not because I'm a hater it's because it's THE TRUTH! Not only I say that the Twilight Saga is horrible but also the best writer Stephen King also agrees it's horrible! Any knowledgable person agrees.",

I can name about a dozen stupid twists, impossible circumstances, and idiotic writing prose each on each of the books. I've even read them all, and I still cannot fathom why such a horrible book has such a loyal readership. No, 'loyal' isn't the right word.",

Go back to English class and learn how to use the language properly for writing and then you'll see how many horrid mistakes are in the books. They're rife with grammatical errors, the characters are vapid and one-dimensional, and unlike J.K. Rowling, Stephenie Meyer does not know how to string a good well thought-out story together. It's just whiny angst. Teenagers CAN and ARE CAPABLE of reading much better literature than Twilight.",

And like I said before, if it was \"poorly made\" they wouldnt have made so much money off of it, simple as that. Oh, and because they have all the money they wouldnt poorly make this movie, they have enough money for the best special effects and actors out there.",

Yeah I liked it in the book form (never as much as HP)....when I was a preteen but Kristin Stewart ruined it for me with her horrible acting. So did R.Patt...which is sad because he's a great actor otherwise. This whole thing is just so...unnecessary. And the first 2 movies were shit. The 3rd was pretty good, but..ugh.",

I realise that you are probably a fan of the series, and maybe you havent read any other vampire books. But non the less, calm down. I am not stupid, I just have different views on the matter.",

Just because you make one a sparkly vampire and one a cgi wolf does't give it a plot. Oh I guess I forgot about all of the talking about feelings, face-touching, lip-biting, and eye-rolling. That's definitely worth the 8 bucks and 120 minutes of your time that you'll never get back. Also, 7 minutes of blurry \"vampire-running\" is not an action scene.",
