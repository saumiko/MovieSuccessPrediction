What's the explanation of all of that? I humbly didn't understood it at all really, like what's the explanation of that dimension? where did that came from? That's the only part of the movie where I didn't understand. And also the part where Murph and Amelia Brand touched hands, how in the world did that happened assuming that Brand's already inside Wolf's planet and I also didn't understand about the last part Murph being really old, I thought their place's already in a great famine, hunger, extinction and I was already assuming humanity's already meeting its end. How come she's still able to have children and reach at that age? please help! Thanks!",

    "commentText": "I'll be frank, and it's only because I adored this movie so much that I feel comfortable putting out a slight critique. There were some flaws, some of the emotion was a bit hammy (although Nolan is hardly famous for his human touch) and some of the plot did feel a bit random. However, even though many critics savaged it.... I fucking loved this film and I cried like a baby during certain scenes. As a hardened sci-fi reader, this is the film I've been waiting for, and I feel it's the film I would've made, if I was a lot smarter, had $200million and amazing directing skills. It's like other space films, except it goes beyond the point where they would normally stop and leave things unexplained: this goes to all the levels a sci-fi fan wants. The space travel is astounding, jaw-dropping, terrifying, beautiful (wouldn't normally use such cliche adjectives but... damn). The emotional connection with his daughter moved me to the point of tears. At no point did I feel let down, because it just kept pushing and going to new places. I think the dust needs to settle a bit, because for what it was intended to be, it's a masterpiece. I just know this will end up being one of the films I watch repeatedly for the next 50 years. God damn, I'm so happy it was finally made. This film just fills a void in cinema where a perfect, Interstellar-shaped hole existed. Nolan is a hero of our time.",

On nature of space time (Elegant universe on Steroids) by Brian greene, maybe White light ( for Tiplers paradise and 5 dimensional beings), then proceed to watch this movie.... I keep pondering on the myriad of themes and stunning visual, the Black hole, Millers planet, Manns planet, the Tesseract, Bulk beings... I was sorry they did not show Edmund's planet (at all). One clarification for viewers,Cooper is trapped in Tesseract which is a 5 dimensional space,(Tiper's Paradise) this allows him to be in all time in all places simultaneously,he can choose where he wants to see(??how) but cannot communicate because he is beyond event horizon of a black hole. In the end he can leave the tesseract and enter a universe that is ready to receive him (maybe created for him at the instant of collapse of tesseract). Only one plot loop hole, if Copper has travelled all the way to 120years and Quantum gravity has been discovered, why any one has not gone to Edmund's planet till this day??",

As the last chance to save humanity.. Come on.. And all that on a secret base located in corn fields a few dozen miles from his house.. Kiss my back.. That main actor whatever his name had a bad play (maybe because of film director..) he looks and sounds more like a spoiled Hollywood actor than as an engineer hahah)) And all crew keep saying thick trivialities about theory of relativity.. For the spectator to grasp.. All the while they penetrate wormholes and black holes.. Actually - but that's something else - black wholes actually crush whole galaxies with such gravity power that even light gets trapped in.. Means probably a human spacecraft blows to dust way before it approaches its \"horizon\". Real, funny movie, interesting scenario, good esthetics, but quite too dumb to make a 2001 Odyssey II..",

    "commentText": "As a kid I use to read the short stories by science fiction greats Issac Asimov, Arthur C. Clarke and others. I use to read a lot about Albert Einstein and his many theories and see if I could prove the ones he missed. I use to think my grandfather's workshop must have been what Einstein's laboratory must have looked like as I was amazed at the things my grandfather could do. This is a movie that I think they would all love. This is a movie I have been waiting a long time for! Throughout the film my wife was constantly amazed as to how I knew what was about to happen as though I had already seen the movie which I swear I hadn't. I highly recommend this movie! Do not go gentle into that good night, Old age should burn and rave at close of day; Rage, rage against the dying of the light. Though wise men at their end know dark is right, Because their words had forked no lightning they Do not go gentle into that good night. Good men, the last wave by, crying how bright Their frail deeds might have danced in a green bay, Rage, rage against the dying of the light. Wild men who caught and sang the sun in flight, And learn, too late, they grieved it on its way, Do not go gentle into that good night. Grave men, near death, who see with blinding sight Blind eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay, Rage, rage against the dying of the light. And you, my father, there on the sad height, Curse, bless, me now with your fierce tears, I pray. Do not go gentle into that good night. Rage, rage against the dying of the light. Dylan Thomas, 1914 - 1953",

Wouldn't logic tell us to go for whichever one was less \"time\" consuming, first? so that they could at least let those on earth know the results of the first planet FASTER, so earthlings could prepare better?",

Evidently, what would happen if one actually did attempt to enter a black hole is when one approached the event horizon, the gravity of the black hole would begin pulling one apart, bit by bit. As one entered the black hole, one would be separated into smaller and smaller pieces, like a string of macaroni. Now, if they had showed that, I would have stuck with the movie.",

    "commentText": "Here's my take. A valiant attempt to take on a big block buster sci-fi movie about quantum physics and deep human themes of love and humanity. However, I think Nolan bit off more than he could chew with this one. After viewing, I kept thinking this film was over indulgent in nearly every way. The characters were weak, plot rushed (terrible flow), overly melodramatic, and ultimately disappointing in its scope. What he lacked in those key areas he tried to make up with state of the art special effects and a suffocation of scientific information (there's nothing wrong with that in general but it's just foolish to try and cram that level of cosmology and quantum physics education into a 3 hour mainstream movie). To me, Nolan is like the Starbucks of film making; on the surface his style and choice of themes seem intellectual and authentic. However, under that surface is just a watered down, massed produced corporate product under the guise of quality. I don't think this is a masterpiece in the same way \"2001\" or \"Alien\" were. Just like the album \"The Wall\" by Pink Floyd or the film \"Apocalypse Now\" by Francis Ford Coppola, this movie aimed way too high without hitting the mark.",

We are facing something mysthiscal, and the handshake whit the living is like a ghost`s in our life, like sometimes when yo ufeel someones present near you, but there is no one...Like somone is trying to warn us that we are doing mistake..In the end we come to the Heaven, our last wish is to see our beloved, but we cant stand that fact, that this is the last time, the last godbye whit them..And finally we have to let them and continue or path whitout looking back...This movie real hit me like a train whenever I watch it...Great scenario, whit great message..Maybe my idea is sort of strange but I just wanted to share this whit someone...Anyone.",

And INTERSTELLAR is NOT in the list for any Major Award except for some audio-visual effects and Hans Zimmer's OST. That means it's a really good movie after all; since apparently almost all the stinking Hollywood old dummy reviewers disliked its advanced scenario. But anyway, Mr. Nolan et al., thanks for making this masterpiece movie, which will be appreciated a century later in 2115, like we appreciate now Fritz Lang's Metropolis (1927), 88 years after its release.",

    "commentText": "What an amazing movie! Well acted, well written and an amazing story/meaning. Nolan never fails to impress. In advance. I want to say sorry for being THAT guy but I feel deeply offended by comments I see regarding religion :). If you are willing to listen to my opinion without spreading hate then click read more. I am happy to accept any of your RESPCTFUL arguments. :) May I say that I do not study religion nor do I know a whole lot about others. I do however believe in God for various reasons. I am a Muslim so I am speaking in my religions point of view :). Many people may say that religion and science will never mix but I say and believe different. I would also like to clarify that there are also many things said in Islam (and other religions) that science cannot answer, therefore they are dismissed and considered inaccurate so I will not cover that (I'll leave it to the experts xD). I just want to clear up that the Qur'an is historically proven to have been the oldest holy book that has been preserved and kept the same over 1400+ years (The time of it's revelation). What I'm saying here is that the Bible, Torah etc. were changed over time. That is a FACT. Here is the most known example of science in the Qur'an. The birth of a human: The miracle of man's creation is emphasised in many verses. Some of the information within these verses is so detailed that it was impossible for anyone living in the 7th century to have known it. Examples of these are as follows: 1. Man is not created from the entire semen, but only a very small portion of it (sperm). 2. It is the male that determines the sex of the baby. 3. The human embryo adheres to the mother's uterus like a leech. 4. The embryo develops in three dark regions in the uterus. Let's pick out verses from the Qur'an that mention these. 1. Sperm undertake a journey into the mother's body until they reach the ovum. Only a thousand out of 250 million sperm succeed in reaching the ovum. At the end of this five-minute race, the ovum, half the size of a grain of salt, will let only one of the sperms in. That is, the substance of man is not the whole semen, but only a small part of it. This is explained in the Surat al-Qiyama as follows: Does man reckon he will be left uncontrolled [without purpose]? Was he not once a drop of ejected semen? (Qur'an, 75:36-37) 2. Until fairly recently, it was thought that a baby's sex was determined by the mother's cells. Or at least, it was believed that the sex was determined by the male and female cells together. But, we are given different information in the Qur'an, where it is stated that masculinity or femininity is created out of \"a drop of sperm which has been ejected.\" He has created both sexes, male and female from a drop of semen which has been ejected. (Qur'an, 53:45-46) Was he not a drop of ejaculated sperm, then a blood-clot which He created and shaped, making from it both sexes, male and female? (Qur'an, 75:37-39) The developing disciplines of genetics and molecular biology have scientifically validated the accuracy of this information given by the Qur'an. It is now understood that sex is determined by the sperm cells from the male, and that the female has no role in this process. The Qur'an even talks about the development of a foetus! [We] then formed the drop into a clot and formed the clot into a lump and formed the lump into bones and clothed the bones in flesh; and then brought him into being as another creature. Blessed be Allah, the Best of Creators! (Qur'an, 23:14) (All Information above is taken from http://miraclesofthequran.com/scientific_57.html) Now to Stephen Hawking's theory. In the Qur'an, which was revealed fourteen centuries ago at a time when the science of astronomy was still primitive, the expansion of the universe was described in the following terms: And it is We Who have constructed the heaven with might, and verily, it is We Who are steadily expanding it. (Qur'an, 51:47) The word \"heaven,\" as stated in the verse above, is used in various places in the Qur'an. It is referring to space and the wider universe. Here again, the word is used with this meaning, stating that the universe \"expands.\" The Arabic word \"moosiaaoona\" in the term \"inna lamoosiaaoona,\" translated into English as \"it is We Who are steadily expanding it\", comes from the verb \"evsea,\" meaning \"to expand.\" The prefix \"la\" emphasises the following name or title and adds a sense of \"to a great extent.\" This expression therefore means \"We expand the sky or the universe to a great extent.\" This is the very conclusion that science has reached today. All this was known to Muhammad (Peace be upon him) 15 hundred years ago! All things we have recently discovered. Please take in mind that I am 13 (14 soon) I am not just a Muslim because I was born into it. I am a Muslim because I believe what it teaches is right! Not the BS you see in the media (ISIS, Al Qaeda etc.) I would also like to say that I respect all of your opinions and I thank you for listening to mine :) Have a great day!",

I remember watching the scene where he fell through the worm whole at the end and into the \"5th dimension\" space. I first thought wtf Im trippin out because I was taken back by it all but everything came together after watching that scene and I know some of the space physics seems fantasy but it does make you wonder the infinite possibilities in terms of space travel and maybe we as humans can only comprehend space , time and gravity through 3 dimensional space or through laws that we can only comprehend. lol Im thinking about watching it on my own next time as my friend was so disruptive asking questions throughout the movie",

    "commentText": "That space shuttle launch at 1:27 looked pretty ridiculous though. From that point of view the speed is nearly as fast as it seems to move. I know that it's with future technology, but a quicker escape velocity isn't an advantage. You'd just burn more fuel to achieve the same resoult. And why no fuel remnant at all? Where does the mass dissapear? Compare to real rocket launch and the speed is way below that, while still having escape velocity. Taking E=mv¬≤ into account, that rocket's velocity would have been highly impractical. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsRuJ37kyZg This is why I don't watch movies. I'm just way OCD to get put off by the obvious irrationalities. Why can't they just do it right? I've seen plenty of movies with e.g. semi-automatic bolt action rifles. I just can't watch it after that. The feeling is ruined.",

LOL Oh yeah, In order to live on another planet, NASA is going to have to do what NOAH'S ARC did.. because you need HONEY BEES and Tons of other Earth Creatures to make Life possible elsewhere. Vegetation and Plant life depends on, not only water and the Sun's Energy, but also All vital Biological and Organic CREATURES to continue Life on a Planet like Earth. Every Biological and Organic thing Alive on Earth works as One System composed of vital Systems built upon other vital Systems in order for LIFE to Exist here. If any generation on Earth destroys Half of the SYSTEMS or other vital parts of the System, there would be ZERO LIFEFORMS on Earth. That is a Scientific Fact. So, NASA would need to build a NOAH'S ARC type Spaceship to carry all the Earth Creatures and Sea Creatures to the next Planet in order to continue LIFE elsewhere. If you take the PEOPLE of Earth, you have to take all the CREATURES that help LIFE exist on Earth. Nonetheless....Enjoy this HOLLYWOOD MOVIE! :) My favorite part of the Movie?? When the School Faculty tells Cooper that NASA'S MOON landings were a bunch of BS! hahahahaha Nice touch! TRUTHERS are Legend....",

    "commentText": "People I want to tell you an urgent and very important message, and I want to say this very seriously, that this may be the last warning to America and to all the nations of the world ! Please come to Jesus Christ the Son of God now ! Repent, for the Kingdom of Heaven has come near ! I'm telling you that this is the generation that will witness to the second coming of Jesus Christ on the earth... and that will take place immediately after a period of Great Tribulation of maximum 7 years that is about to start taking place all around the earth... I'm sure many of you heard about the New World Order... I'm telling you this is not a conspiracy theory... this is very real... and the New World Order is now proclaimed in many nations all around the world, and it is about to be launched at the global level... bringing a one world government and a one world economic system based on RFID Chips, and I'm telling you whoever takes that RFID Chip, even if he comes to repentance... he will never be able to receive the forgiveness of sins from God, and therefore he will burn in hell for eternity... therefore I'm telling you all... please come to Jesus Christ the Son of God now, do not delay repentance, for you do not know if you will reach home tonight, or if you will wake up in the morning... and therefore where will you reach then, or where will you wake up ? I'm telling you hell is so real, you just don't want to wake up there one day... but you also can't get to Heaven without Jesus Christ... I'm telling you, evolution is a devastating lie that came right from the mouth the devil... and religion that says that whoever simply believes in God... but does the will of the devil, and somehow he will be saved... is an absolute hypocrisy... Jesus Christ the Son of God said very clearly in John 14:6: \"I am the Way, the Truth, and the Life. No one comes to the Father except through Me.\" I warn every single one of you here who reads this message, not because I so like to judge people and warn them, but because I want to tell you something very seriously, that you just don't realize how many traps the devil has placed for people at the global level... and he is desperately waiting to steal, kill, and destroy as many people as he will manage to... and the coming events... when they will start, it's going to be like an avalanche, when it will start, it will destroy everything in its way until it reaches the end... it's going to be overwhelming... I urge you to put your hope in Jesus Christ, He is the Son of God who came 2000 years ago, and taught people how to live right, moral, and holy in speech and acts, but many people did not want to listen to Him, and few were those who actually listened to Him, and took Him in serious, and followed Him... but the pharisees, the sadducees, and the scribes were the ones who were against Him, and wronged Him, and crucified Him, but because He was without sin, and because He was righteous, and holy in everything He said and did... even death could not stand against Him... He rose from the dead on the third day... being the Only True Savior for the human being, humanity, people... and He is coming very soon to judge the living and the dead... only those who truly believe in Him, not only by saying that they believe, but by living according to the faith, and living the way the Bible teaches that a true believer must live, only these people will be delivered from the Day of Judgement and from hell, and will be saved, and will be taken directly into the Kingdom of Heaven to live forever with Jesus Christ in the direct presence of God... I just want to tell you one more thing that I want you to understand very clearly, repentance is not a religious term, it is simply when man comes in his room alone, it does not have to be in front of some people or something... the man comes in his room alone, and comes in prayer to God in the Name of Jesus Christ, and simply prays this prayer: \"Lord Jesus, I know that You have died on that cross in my place, for my sins, and You rose from the dead on the third day, just to give me salvation Lord. Father please forgive me of my sins, and please save me from the Day of Judgement and from hell, and after death, please save me and take me directly in Your Kingdom God, I pray to you Father from Heaven, in the Name of Jesus Christ. Amen\".",

If it where a movie which tried to explore the anomalies of the universe in a more imaginative manner without being tied down too much by the technicalities ... it would've been much more inspirational. But, execution of the movie was perfect, visually stunning and very immersive .. just didn't leave me thinking about it too much.",

It is a great tribute to 2001: a space odyssey, it is a really challenging movie, it plays with your mind and imagination to the maximum degree.It is about love, hope, dreams, faith, family and evolution of humanity - not only in technological sense but in emotional sense as well. If you're sc-fi or movie fan in general you're going to be blown away and it is something to experience. Sure it has some logical issues and you have to suspend your disbelief but it is a rewarding movie and despite it being derivative, it is still unbelievable seeing the idea this big from someone's mind translated onto a big screen. 4.5/5",

If you liked gravity , go and see the movie its gravity + inception",

    "commentText": "I'm afraid this will be another disappointing sci-fi movie, like Gravity. It will probably be filled with all sorts of misconceptions about space, even though Kip Thorne has been the scientific consultant for it (and also executive producer). Remember the movie \"Sunshine\" from 2007? Brian Cox was the scientific consultant for that one, and yet the movie was filled with all sorts of misconceptions and inaccuracies that made me laugh. And what about Gravity? That unknown force that pulled Clooney away from the ISS was a total joke, same for the orbital nonsense between the Hubble, the ISS and the Russian satellites, etc. Just so you know, Interstellar tells the story of a group of astronauts who \"travel\" through a black hole...with hopes of going somewhere else and then return to Earth, that is. For all science knows, the laws of physics break down inside a black hole due to the tremendous gravitational pull, that means that we can't possibly know, through physics, what happens exactly to things that cross the \"event horizon\" (that's the edge of the black hole, so to speak). All science can tell for sure is that when something crosses the event horizon, there's no turning back, if you somehow managed to come out, it wouldn't be alive and in one piece. When Hawking talks about how it is possible for information to be preserved inside a black hole, it just means INFORMATION, in other words, the particles that form your body could still be \"preserved\" somehow but you would die nonetheless, all your atoms would be undone, and that isn't pretty. Whoever tells you that you can travel through black holes (survive the journey and come back to the same universe as if nothing happened, that is), doesn't have the math/mechanism to support this claim and Kip Thorne knows it. I bet all Kip has done is to help model the black hole, give direction to actors who will play scientist roles and perhaps a few more things, but I'm pretty sure this movie will still contain nonsense. Sci-fi directors usually claim they've made sure everything is scientifically accurate, showing us stuff like this> Interstellar ‚Äì Building A Black Hole ‚Äì Official Warner Bros. so people can say \"Oh! This time they've got it right!\" when, in reality, only some things are accurate, the rest is usually nonsense. Movies like Sunshine and Gravity are clear examples of this. Curiously, there is a 1968 movie called \"2001: A Space Odyssey\" (perhaps you've heard about it, LOL) that gets most things right, without the need of using unlikely black hole travel, without the need to sell it for its \"realism\" or scientific accuracy, without flashy special effects, absurd amounts of money and without being too pretentious. The non-scientific parts of that movie are highly symbolic, which make it even better. So Hollywood sci-fi movies nowadays have much larger budgets, a much higher availability of professionals from all branches, highly superior technology available, they generate much more money, etc. and yet they are worse every year... Why is that? I think it's because the essential guidelines of the business are wrong. They go for flashiness (big names, high numbers, extreme and flashy plots, etc.) instead of quality, they try to conciliate science with nonsensical extreme plots that are completely incompatible and absurd (my point being> don't try to sell the movie for its realism and accuracy if, in the end, it won't be so). This is the formula: big names + claims of scientific accuracy/realism + extreme plots filled with nonsense (the world is about to end, there's a critical accident/everything goes wrong, and the like) + stuff blowing up/getting destroyed + miraculous survivals + ultra hd cameras and all sorts of modern filters and effects + the hero saves the day (requiring his/her/their sacrifice, perhaps) = Next Hollywood sci-fi movie.",

Ok, let's have the IMPOSSIBLE happen because Kip Thorne wants to be known as an Imagineer like Einstein was, he wants his legacy to be that he imagined further than his knowledge should have allowed, he was a hero. SO for that personal objective, we are now going to be fed a bag of worms about how people can survive going through a wormhole... oh great! So first he tries to teach us that engineers are obsolete, then he tries to teach us that science built this thing!?? NOPE TO BOTH. In the scenes they pull the power pack processing package from the Indian drone, as useful... oh wait, that's engineering. Then they say we ran out of food, what... did engineering fail to come up with solutions? NO WAY, engineers would have had people living where ever, with desalination wholesale, protected from radiation. Listen, if engineering can build a star ship to go exploring to move MILLIONS of people off this planet, the same engineering would have built the systems to remake a new place to live on Earth, probably under the sea! So this whole movie is based on... Kip Thorne playing around with his legacy. So yeah, they all die and the movie ends after 12 minutes. Let's all get refunds!! hehe",

Personally I think it will be a pandemic that will wipe us out, especially how strong and resilient anti-biotic resistant bacteria has become.",

        "commentText": "+Roger Moore Why would you want our race to die on Earth when the universe has given us intelligence through natural processes to reach for the stars? To die on Earth when we could survive is against nature. It's against life that is programmed to survive. A baby doesn't stay in womb, a bird doesn't stay in the nest forever. Earth is our womb and nest for a time. The universe belongs to no-one and everyone. We will never conquer it whole because only a few planets can ever sustain us. You need to realize we carry the knowledge of all life and natural phenomena of our planet. We need to save it for the future, for the next stage of evolution whether that be organic or inorganic. We just can't let knowledge about wonderful creatures like the Tyrannosaurus Rex die with us. Someone needs to survive and keep the data alive as a legacy until the end of the universe so that everything hasn't gone to waste.",

Nolan brothers does it again Batman Begins - the trendsetter showing the pain and personal life issues of Superheroes. U never saw that in any movie before. Lol Dark knight - one word...JOKER..everyone loved it for the evil mind of a criminal designed by Nolan of course. Plus the plot.!! Dark Knight rises - Good film as a whole. Didn't make an impact probably coz of the hype set by its predecessor The Inception - In my opinion the second best movie by Nolan. And Leonardo ..Just wow.!! Interstellar - ????",

    "commentText": "I love space movies, many of them are enthralling; I ardently respect all those astronauts who go to space and carry out experiments aboard the ISS. But, as a resident of this planet, I would love it if humanity would be less cruel to nature, and help maintain the balance of our ecosystem, by reducing pollution, violence, killing of animals. I am sure that no one will ever migrate to any other planet(Mars being the only option), because our body does not suit their atmosphere-if anyone goes on interplanetary travel, I am sure it will be a 1 way trip, and the whole world's population will never go, except astronauts & crazy billionaires. The Earth has life for a reason, no other planet has that, and we should be grateful for that. Wormholes are still a theory, but, if it is found to exist, interstellar travel will be carried out by astronauts only; 7 billion(who knows, 14 billion in the future) will never go and colonize on Alpha Beta whatever new planet that's discovered; we shall perish anyway due to geological events, maybe a massive earthquake, too much pollution, poisonous radiation from space etc. So, my point is, space travel should only be in fiction, novels and movies, and whatever NASA is doing, at least for now. It would be much useful for Earth & humanity's survival, if we concentrate on eradicating diseases, inventing a cure for all incurable diseases, reducing pollution of air/water/sound/land/electronic waste/radioactive waste etc., finding alternate ways of harnessing pollution free energy, letting animals live, and reducing violence, and lastly, doing all the mentioned work on a major scale(not like, only 20 cars run on electricity and the rest use gas) because, if the Earth survives, we do too-and the longer we live, the longer we can experiment on space travel. But Earth is our home and foundation, and we must not forget that.",

It may comment here and there about the use of non-reusable fuel sources (e.g. coal, gasoline, etc.), but seems like it'll be geared, mostly, towards space exploration. I think the trailer might be 90% plot exposition, 10% actual movie. In other words, I think (and hope) that most of the trailer is only the beginning of the film, and when they go through the Wormhole is when everything really kicks off.

This makes me wanna go into the theater and find out where the hell Mathew McConahickie is going, I wanna know what's gonna happen but see, I can only find that shit out by watching the movie.

I know I am saddened by war, world hunger, political corruption, and social injustice; our current social ills, hollow innovations, mindless celebrity worship, superficial ambitions, and social superiority. Perhaps this trailer makes me believe that humanity is still destined for things greater than those which so morbidly depress me. Perhaps it makes me believe that the age of discovery is not over, that the true spark of innovation still exists somewhere, that there's still a sense of wonder to relished in our efforts. Perhaps this why i cry, out of hope.",

Because the global 'elite' (or idiots) think mankind should be reduced to a controlled 500,000 people. That only they should live forever, transferring their 'souls' into machines so they can eventually make those machines more 'human' looking but with endless life spans. People need to turn off the tv and look around, see the chemtrails they spray over head, that gives us all kinds of decease, the toxic GMO crops that sterilize men and women so by their third generation no one or 'other' life form will be able to reproduce. Then they will clone humans, shorten their lifespans and control them under a failed program of socialism, which doesn't work and the human race will disappear by the year 3000. This is the problem with those who think that because they are rich they should control everything. People just want to live in peace, raise a family and provide for them. We don't want endless stupid wars, or pushy governments telling us what we should buy, or do.. We just want to be free.. So, we all need to tell them.. F#$K OFF..",

But that was the gift of the gravitational beings: the ability to be in a place that is beyond time and life itself. This secret, however, was previously discovered by the--I can't remember what country; they stayed within that space for a period of four thousand earth years. But that much time allowed them to develop the gravitational device, which ultimately saved the human race from the beginning due to MC's daughter. So the plane you see in the beginning? Indian? Originally, it was Russian. There's a probe in there that leads MC to pursue the quest to save the human race. But that probe was him--more or less.",

Our lives are just too short and there are too many factores that makes earth livable to, that this will ever be realistic. But i like the concept and popcorn :-)",

During the existence of the Earth there have been over a handful of mass extinctions caused by different things. We have the technology and the means to survive some things, but the odds are that we will eventually have to just leave the planet. Let's say we find a way to prevent all those things, the sun is not going to last forever. Perfecting interstellar travel is the only way we can truly survive as a species. The ability to pick up our things and move to a different location is our only true means of survival, and you wouldn't want it to be the last thing you do before something catastrophic occurs. Chances are, by then it is too late.",

It's also important to note that both interplanetary and interstellar travel would allow life to express itself in far more ways than it can in its current state, trapped within the confines of Earth's gravity well. Life needs to be able to expand and grow; only then will we be able to experience life's adaptations to the most extreme environments.

    "commentText": "the idea behind this film is simple, the ability to use a wormhole to jump to another planet and find a livable environment is perfectly plausible, though highly unlikely, and depending on the development of technology and the plausibility of being able to colonize mars and sustain that would not be plausible at all, we have technology to make that work for some time, but not for the 50+years this film is seeming to aim at. Interstellar travel is a fact of live and will happen eventually assuming our race evolves enough and the parameters of physics happen, due to the high likelihood that the ability of earth to sustain us as lifeforms will end. and while we may not know exactly how wormholes work in every facet, they do seem to be the best option in terms of interstellar travel out there due to the distances between solar systems being to great. this movie isn't silly, nor is it illogical based on the parameters it gives, its just exploring a thought path that we will probably explore one day. also as far as the food problem, that could very easily happen based on solar emission spectra changing in the slightest manner due to the core composition of our sun changing, so no it is not stupid, please stop talking as if you know everything in the field of astrophysics and biology, life isnt that simple.",

First off in you see an Indian drone or UAV, this means that America is no longer the top dog anymore which is more likely the case in the future with the East being more dominate Russia, China or India. This movie seems to cater to the masses that believe in global warming which can hamper current food supply which is a possibility. Last we see the space tech which has been recently revealed by Nasa using warp drive based on a proven theory by a Mexican astrophysists. We don't see no wormholes in this trailer, but we do see a ship with a mass ring around it and we also see a bubble that pulls, expands and decontracts the space around it. Most likely its warp drive. Also in the beginning you see the boy grown man, and later on in the trailer you see the girl in a red hair also grown wearing Matthews jacket.",

I totally want to see us go to space, but can we PLEASE stop this bull about the planet being a train wreck, and we have to get off the train? Yes, I get that they want to have a 'compelling' reason to go to space, but what about doing it as a voyage of discovery? Are we too cynical these days? There are lots of good reasons to go to space that have nothing to do with the planet 'dying'. Such as gathering resources (even in our own solar system); there are trillions of dollars worth of resources (various metals) in the form of asteroid mining, or Helium 3 extraction, etc. That would create jobs, and do a hell of a lot for certain resource scarcities.",

Climate change has been going on for billions of years, and it isn't about to stop. We humans definitely need to stop making messes, but we aren't killing the planet wholesale. If the Earth really got ticked off at us, it could wipe us out and start over, no biggie. So to speak. I just get annoyed with the 'humans are causing the Earth to turn into a colossal desert' scenario. It is a myth used by certain folks to dupe the gullible with eco-guilt. That doesn't mean I'm against clean tech, but we need to do it for valid reasons. Not for the mythological hype.",

I just hope that despite Matthew McConaughey's and his team's vast interstellar travel, they will be able to maintain an interconnectedness between the other characters residing on Earth. The greatest impact a movie can have on its audience is one that possesses characters who are relatable, in the sense of portraying humanity in a realistic light when confronted by these usual-to-unusual circumstances.",

But if you really want to know why they used circular shape, maybe because of Alcubierre drive, which is a theory of reason behind warp travel. In this theory the spaceship contracts space in front of it and expands space behind it. which can be used to travel faster than light without experiencing g-force. So maybe the space ship in the trailer contracts the space in front of it or they did it with some kinda device making it a circular shape.",

He will, but the uncertainty is if SHE (MANKIND) will be there when he returns. If you talk about interstellar space travel, time dilation is the number one factor in planning for it. You can't get around it unless Eisenstein was wrong. Unless its a wormhole. But that leaves more uncertainty because we're not sure what's on the otherside.of it. Matthew's character seems certain he is coming back, just not to what (state of the planet). We do know about Time Dilation though. I hope someone tackles this in a plot if he didn't.",

It might not be true as it's mathematical and it is used by averaging out etc. but isn't it scary to think that there are 6 planets identical to earth in species and ecosystem. Space really is the next step to human evolution, and i think the whole idea of \"mankind was born here. it wasn't meant to die here\" applies to every living species. Since mankind evolved from apes, who knows what evolved into apes, we could've been a water breathing species. No one really knows. But space is a scary thing and this movie will make a statement a very scary statement.",

A little more thinking on the who, what, where, and when caused a 'click' towards \"V for Vendetta\" as a possible candidate. Yesterday I downloaded V for Vendetta to my new Galaxy S Smartphone and to my laptop and indeed found the track that matched the music in the \"Interstellar\" trailer. Very often the trailers use the tracks from other movies. What I was not aware of was the title of the track...aka.... \"Every's Reborn\". I think I will go to Itunes now and purchase it. Thanks SuperHarryFan. I truly appreciate it. (I suspect you are possibly an \"Original Motion Picture Soundtracks\" fan.",

The thing I disagree is that apparently humans destroyed Earth, and now they are going to other place, this does not have anything to do with the main theme of Interstellar first trailer. In that one, human wante to discover the unknown. Now, they have to move to anotherplace becasue their home is wasted (by them). Also, if you travel trough a worm hole the time changes, so, what is the point to travel there if when you come back to earth, a lot of years have passed by?? It is no easie trying on mars?? IT is not easier trying to save Earth?? If you could fly close to Saturn so fast, could enter inside a Worm Hole, maybe you could have some ways to save Earth or install Mars Colony.",

For one thine, while Interstellar travel is strictly an engineering and physics problem, \"feeding the world\" is far more than that. It's also a social and a political problem. Human technology has never, ever been anywhere near as effectual at dealing with sociology or politics, as it has with dealing with mere physical laws. There may very well be in fact a solution to the problem of interstellar flight, and yet no solution whatsoever to the problem of feeding billions of people systematically on earth. Especially under extremely adverse conditions, involving the total breakdown of all existing agricultural systems, and the social chaos that almost certainly comes with that, which is what this trailer implies is going on in that movie.",

        "commentText": "+Argentin Iacob I REALLY hope it's an Alcubierre drive. A wormhole would be a bit contrived, and the spacecraft seems built with the toroidal placement of mass-energy density consistent with an Alcubierre drive as proposed by Dr. Harold Sonny White, plus what's shown isn't consistent with a black hole or white hole, though it may be a wormhole. Both a wormhole and the Alcubierre metric are GR solutions for apparent superluminal travel, so they'd look much the same, the difference is we could generate an Alcubierre warp bubble. Freakishly beautiful, though. I'm obsessed with the Alcubierre drive and really excited to see I'm not the only one! I'm also really curious about some details. Do you know much about it?",

I can understand equations and follow the reasoning behind the idea but in a conceptual way. That's why i think of mathematicians and especially physicists as superhumans (just think of Einstens theories and how mind blowing they are). And this Alcubierre drive is such an elegant way of bypassing the maximum speed limit imposed by GR, given all the conditions are met.",

The ship/crew went through some kind of time warp, was unable to communicate with Earth and everyone was presumed dead. The crew (less a few members) came back at nearly the same age as they left while everyone on Earth aged 20 years. Thanks, trailer. Best guess is that the \"New Earth\" they find is actually very old, pre-human Earth and the survivors go there to live and try to change the path Earth takes toward desolation.",

Pathetic. I bet most of you never saw a single movie from Bergman, Tarkovskij, Vl√°ƒçil or anyone outside Hollywood. For me, Interstellar has an appeal for Nolan's best movie to date (although I love The Prestige). Stunning visuals, attempt for something else than stupid blockbuster and (I hope) honour to the best sci-fi pieces such as 2001: Space Odyssey. Just wait for your brainless Transformers: Zillionth Sequel, that's the title you are looking for.",

Just because I said people like to talk about religion doesn't mean I was talking about you although now that you mention it, you are in that group since you'll claim your smarter than most people because you don't believe in a deity but it doesn't matter.

MOVIES. You know, entertainment like every other movie including the ones you like. You wanna talk about a fake intellectual movie? Go watch a michael bay movie or something. Nolan is not pretentious at least not to me but that's your opinion if you think he is but people like you need to stop bashing things that you haven't even seen and you don't know everything fully about it. I mean at least nolan isn't sitting on his ass talking shit about other people like you. He's out there doing something and creating something whether you like it or not. But stick to your crappy experimental films and go through life thinking you're better than everyone else because of how you think. And how do you know I'm not atheist too? That's how dumb \"Youtube Experts on Life\" are. You don't know everything so chill. If you don't like Nolan. Don't see the fucking movie. Simple as that. Bitching doesn't do anything except make you look like a bitch. Besides, I'm pretty sure Tyler Durden would kick your ass anyday :)",

No. When people speak in platitudes about someone they like, it's usually kind of a joke anyway but people on the internet always take it seriously and think they are a crazy fanboy that's overhyping someone when it's not really the case but I think in Nolan's case this happens because there are so many shit movies today and not many directors are really making quality movies so it's pretty normal that if a director comes around and is actually making quality films, people are gonna flock to that like crazy and think great things about him. It's kind of common sense to me. He's not overhyped or overrated. He's just actually appreciated because there's too many michael bays making movies today.",

        "commentText": "Couple of things: To react on both the emptiness and the ambition: I think Christopher Nolan quite often use big ideas that can be quite hard to grasp and sometimes just seems like a complicated bunch of ideas,his movies really make a difference if you watch his movies several times, and you really do have to pay attention. I can perfectly understand you didn't enjoy inception if you slept through a part of it, after that it will be rather impossible to keep up with it.I usually that his movies get more effective emotionally the better you understand them, the easiast example of that is \"the prestige\", which you can easily watch twice if you haven't watched it before, after the revelation (or the prestige as you wish), some dialogue that seemed like pretty random banter becomes really powerful and painful really. Nolan is absolutely no \"champion of marketing cinephilia\", I do love his trailers, but the way it's promoted doesn't show a lot.You seem to forget that both the Prestige and Inception didn't make that much money.The Dark Knight Rises probably was his most anticipated movie, it also wasn't the movie he didn't really wanted to make, as far as I heard he actually wanted to make a movie about Howard Hughes (that's why Bruce Wayne is a mad cripple in the beginning of the movie, there's not even that much batman in the entire movie anyway).The most horrible marketing stuff happened (as you probably know) with \"the Amazing Spiderman 2\" of which the trailers included: the final shot of the movie, a villain that pops up only near the end and worst of all things that aren't even in the movie. I do have to say, because of Chris Nolan (or actually,his succes) quite a lot of bad things have started: all big movies now seem to be dark and gritty and 2,5 hours long but since they usually lack the ideas Nolan's movies have they just end up with a third act where I just did not care. Since Inception movies are quite often become just clever for being clever, also the trailer BWRAAAAAM, getting sick of it (actually not composed by Hans Zimmer).And to pick two things at once: Hans Zimmer, I think the guy is great and I think his work with Christopher Nolan hasn't been anything but wonderful (just look at the succeses of the soundtracks of the batman movies (especially Joker's theme and the \"Deshi Deshi Bashara Bashara\" were really big), the more or less hype that Inception had about it's soundtrack (mostly a \"dream is collapsing\" and \"Time\"),I won't go into detail what I personnaly like so much about it), but I have to say: the man seems to be doing every big movie nowadays, and then he just seems to do nothing but typical Hans Zimmer stuff. \"The true science fiction is philosophical, acurate, complete, emotional, beautiful, epic and there is a developped universe\" absolutely \"To me, Inception and this Interstellar are thriller movies, not science fiction\" Inception is both, Interstellar isn't even out yet but it doesn't seem to be any different, essentially sci-fi is about ideas that are not (yet) possible, the dream thing is one of those and there's no way we could place that story in a more realistic setting. p.s. I do expect a proper answer to this, at first I felt just like saying that you're simply wrong. Also I don't need you to suddenly like Nolan's work, just have a bit more respect for him.",

To watch Inception and see the technical mastery put in to place in that movie and say that it is not ambitious, is just naive. Secondly, just because you define \"true science fiction\" is that does not mean that it is what science fiction is. ALSO, you say that science fiction is \"accurate.\" However, some of the best science fiction movies ARE NOT ACCURATE! Star Wars (arguably science fantasy but whatever), Star Trek, and several other famous sci-fi franchises are all scientifically wrong because they have NOISE IN SPACE! All those lasers blasting in to space would not make a sound. So therefore they aren't science fiction? Please. You don't get to define science fiction as that when it throws out almost the entire genre. Also, science fiction movies don't have to be EPIC. They can be low key and still be great. And how can you have a \"developed universe\" without establishing it in a movie. All I am seeing here is someone who doesn't like Nolan is trying to justify it by sounding smart or clever.",

It's like trying to shit out something you have not eaten - can be kinda difficult. b) you probably meant of Nolan being an over-rated director, not an \"overestimated\" one - unless you are a teenager trying out to look smart. c) give an example of \" philosophical, acurate, complete, emotional, beautiful, epic and there is a developped universe\" sci-fi movie, 'cause I have not seen such a thing. There are no perfect movies out there. Has never been. And likely will never be. What IS important is to have a VARIETY of different sci-fi movies for different people with different tastes to get entertained. I might decide that I like \"Interstellar\" (when I see it), while \"Godzilla\" or \"Jupiter Ascending\" might be more to your liking. Which is OK. But - if I were you - I would not opine about a movie I have not seen, especially based on a trailer that does not reveal much. Unless you are one of stupid people who have nothing better to do.",

There is a lot of garbage in Hollywood coming out so if you can't appreciate films from Nolan, films that really bring something different to the table, I really feel bad for you because there's not much else out there.",

MGS is good fun, but lets say, you (that has a solid snake pic as your picture) starts going on a Skyfall vid and you tell everyone how completely fact it is, how stupid the plot of Skyfall is. When you look at the plot of some of MGS, as fun and entertaining as they may be, and as much as you enjoy it- they are hardly beyond reproach. that was kind of my point. someone lifting there nose up at Nolan fans, while at the same time having taste that's hardly beyond reproach.",

I bet you the best scores will all include Hans' work. also Nolan in the less than 20 years managed to already create a franchise that was so huge it got the whole Marvel universe thing started, and no matter how hard they do their films won't contain half the quality TDK trilogy contained. Inception, prestige, insomnia, momento. The man's literally made 0 crappy movies, sold out to no one. Gets the likes of Al Pacino, Robin Williams, Christian Bale, Hugh Jackman, and Dicaprio to work with him anytime he wants. and now Matthew Mcconaughey. 20 years from now this man will be light years ahead of Spielsberg and Scorcese combined. just coz you enjoy Michael Bay movies doesn't mean that the rest of us won't appreciate a good film (production, acting, music score, directing). Just look at the work he puts into scenes like the rotating zero-gravity hallway scene in inception, or the plane hijack in TDKR (very first scene with Bane). 0 cgi. Nolan's a fucking God.",

If you truly love him you have to be able to criticize him too. I felt a little weird watching this. They're basically saying \"Oh wait, we exhausted the hell out of earth, polluted it to the core, ran it to the ground, lets just move out and find a new home. kthnxbai earth au revoir\". IDK if I'm interpreting it wrong but this is how I felt. I'll still going watch it first preview first day first show for sure. #NOLANFORTHEWIN",

Now if a human was transported to the surface of a living alien world, and he was immersed in alien bacteria and virii, what would happen to him? Nothing good, I'll bet. On the other hand - even if we had the prerequisite technology for a manned interstellar expedition (we don't), such an expedition would require international co-operation, and it would be fantastically expensive. But to reduce carbon emissions to a point at which climate change would be stabilized would also require international co-operation, and it would be - much less expensive. Hmmm.

First, in the preview there appears to be some sort of safe and advanced cryogenic-hibernation or stasis. Secondly, Nuclear Fusion type rocket propulsion would be necessary to reach Saturn's orbit in a reasonable time-frame. Lastly, this safe distance from the Earth would be required in order to activate the very first experimental Alcubierre drive which (in theory) creates a warp-bubble around a spacecraft allowing it to safely break the light-barrier and reach other solar systems. I'm not an astrophysicist, I'm just desperate to leave this planet.",

    "commentText": "This movie is a more realistic take on SciFi and space travel, could be the launching point for a universe of it's own. As much as I like to believe that the earth will one day become Star Fleet Headquarters, it's a bloody pipe dream. Reality of the fact is, if we don't poison and over populate this planet, it's only a matter of time a planetary catastrophe wipes us all out. I dig it. I've always been an avid believer, we need to start looking into leaving earth, ASAP. However that would take a global effort, and humans just aren't that sophisticated or educated yet. I wonder what triggers this mass project in the movie. This seems like the movie I have been waiting for. Something to give the humans a reason to start looking up at the cosmos and embrace our destiny as explorers.",

I found that interesting. I'm thinking when he wakes from his sleep, maybe he comes back to his children all drown up, and he is the same. Who knows. But why are people so mad that they can't figure the plot? The trailer wasn't too confusing, and who wants everything spoiled? MM has been choosing some awesome roles...hard for me to hate him anymore. I think this movie has a lot of promise. Nolan won't disappoint!",

How can we impose specific processes of healing by science? Nature is its' own architect and yet we instill in our minds a control variable whereby we possess or have rather been equipped with the utmost knowledge, specializations, and technology to rejuvenate a dying terrain. Call it loyalty, optimism, hope, faith or any other word, but there may not be a time left for words unless an act of confidence intervene. Let certitude rest in our embarkation as opposed to a previously tottering journey furnished by mere extrospections of indeterminacy. A new leap of faith is born. #INTERSTELLAR #CHRISTOPHERNOLAN",

However, a wormhole has been discovered, and Earth's governments decide to send a team through the wormhole to discover where it leads to. If it is safe, humanity will begin a mass exodus through the wormhole. The main character is an engineer and a pilot, which makes him suitable for such a mission. He has two children, a daughter and a son, which he loves very much. He leaves on the mission unwillingly, promising his children that he will come back. However, years has passed. The main character's children has now grown up (Jessica Chastain plays his grown up daughter, note the similarity between the two) and Earth is in much more dire situation. The main character and his mission has not returned and the children starts looking for answers.",

So basically this movie is about a virus spreading from one planet to another since it's used up the current planet it's inhabiting. Nice.",

I think it's going to be like \"Hunger Games: Catching Fire,\" where the first half of the movie is filmed in standard widescreen, but the rest of the movie (on the other side of the wormhole, and on the alien planet) is filmed in IMAX.",

In all honesty I would suggest that we just don't engage those people. If facts and evidence aren't apart of your intellectual lexicon then the conversation is over. In any case, we will have to leave this planet one day in the future if we are to survive as a species. As we speak the Andromeda galaxy is careening towards our Milky Way, asteroids pass within earths orbit constantly. We are always under threat of extinction. I look forward to a day where we are able to maintain individuality yet also think as a SPECIES, instead of being trapped within the \"nation\" complex. Bravo Chris Nolan!",

At the end he says \"I'm coming back,\" which leaves the implication that a large part of the plot will be around this promise he makes to his daughter. I have a feeling we will never see what is on the other side of the wormhole. I think most of the space voyage will be on the way to the wormhole, leaving space for some sort of plot twist at the end of the movie.",

Have we now reached a point where if a movie or television show doesn't specifically spell every little tiny detail out for you...you miss the point...or think it sucks? I swear I am living through the movie \"Idiocracy\". The plot is simple and completely explained in the trailer. The Earth is going through an \"end of days\" type disaster where we can no longer grow food, our main character has seemingly wasted his life on becoming an engineer (since the world is ending who needs engineers), everybody in the world is attempting to figure out how to save the world, humanity finally makes the decision that we aren't supposed to save the world, we are supposed to leave this planet behind and explore the cosmos, to do this...humanity's last surviving scientists come together to solve the problem of interstellar travel (hence the name \"INTERSTELLAR\"). I got all of this from that one trailer as this is the first I have seen it, and I have not read anything about it. I can't wait to see how dumb this planet has become in 10 years time...",

In an era where Hollywood blockbusters basically tell you the whole story in the space of 2 minutes it is a welcome relief to watch a trailer that is a bikini.",

I mean we've had a couple of flashy remakes, star treks and things like that but i can't really think of anything set in a new universe in the last 10 years.",

Which this one does. It does not spoon feed it to you. A trailer is supposed to make you want to go see the movie to find out what it is all about. Not to give away everything in the story so you can understand the whole movie. Trailers give away too much lately. I am glad this one keeps some secrets.",

    "commentText": "+The Ayala Factor Just to clarify, they're not going into a black hole, their space ship essentially creates a tiny one, or a singularity, to warp space-time, which allows for faster than light travel. Nothing could survive a black hole, nothing made of matter at least, the gravity of a black hole would rip the ship and its occupants apart down to the individual atoms. This movie is based on real scientific theory. And though some black hole theories account for the possibility of traveling vast distances of the universe if one went through it, all one has to do is account for the sheer gravitational power of the black hole beyond the event horizon to know that its just not possible. Hope that adds more clarity to you.",

Knowing if you were even slightly above intelligence on the matter that you should have said \"I do not know which is more sad\" not \"I don't know what's sadder\" Improper English there buddy for trying to insult a person. Now to the matter at hand. First off I never demeaned the film nor have I ever come close to stating my level of intelligence. I quite understood and followed rather quite easily the deeper and more weaved concepts which Inception had in it. I am just stating that from everything that has been hyped about this movie, that it will be a great sci-fi film, the trailer show cases less of the science fiction aspect of that and more of the human factor to having to leave the planet behind. Now this is not a bad thing in concept or in a film? No, and I would enjoy seeing that type of film, however as I said from what this trailer shows it appears as if this will a two and a half hour long movie in which over two thirds of it will be dealing with planet type issues. If I am wrong like someone stated above awesome! But I do get for some reason a feeling in which I am close to correct then that would make me think that there will be further additions to this story which given how the first played out I could be game for. Now what about that do you now find more sad, you presumptuous fail of a troll? Any concepts you still believe to be beyond me now?",

But.....there are other sources of food, both animal and vegetable. Not all of the Entire World's food comes from midwestern cornfields! If you live in a vacuum and have never travelled the world you might think that what Hollywood says could be accurate. But it is not. The whole premise behind Interstellar Travel should be to explore other worlds, gather resources, and build space-faring communities, not to escape the planet Earth. If you were to dispose of the intriguing scenes where they are in space, what you are left with is a movie that sounds like the Kurt Russell flop: \"Escape from L.A.\", only on a global scale. The Earth is beautiful my friends, and there are many many people who are actually succeeding at keeping it that way.",

So we can move on to the next thing or planet in this case, and throw it away when the time comes too! I don't think enough people understand just how valuable something like a planet like Earth is. Is it any small wonder we haven't found any other planets out there readily capable of supporting life? Planets like Earth may be the most valuable thing in the Universe! It literally mean the world to you, and me. Ugh. The premise of this movie makes me sick. Heads up though; we are indeed short on engineers, companies can't get enough of them! What we do have too much of though is PEOPLE and I don't think there will be an end to how much food we can salvage/produce. Nonetheless this looks like an entertaining and interesting movie. Its just the idea's that its based on that makes me worry.",

The family composition (little girl, her elder brother and main protagonist) reminds me of Spielberg's TWOTW, but casting here is worse, unfortunately. TL;DR: The sci-fi part of this movie is very promising, but the focus on family drama worries me a lot.",

What Nolan does best is make films about complex subject matters and ideas, and make them appeal to a mass audience. So he adds the spectacle of the grand score, visuals and performances, but doesn't treat his audience like idiots. While we have films like Transformers 4 coming out which looks like just a series of explosions, Nolan will probably give his audience something to engage their minds with. :)",

The Batman Trilogy always showed us images but never revealed the plot. And Inception was who knows what (though it did imply Leonardo DiCaprio was trying to steal an idea rather than implant one). So I'm just going to wait and see Secondly- The music is phenomenal Third- Haha. So many engineers are getting offended. Relax... it's a movie",

Heavy heavy on the cornball family stuff and light on the expensive special effects. And probably about 45 minutes too long. I'll wait. i dont get movie channels on cable so maybe red box if the wife is nagging me to rent something ANYTHING and theres nothing else. I could be wrong hope i am. But i quit the $15/person theatres 3 years ago and haven't looked back",

I really think that this one might be a flop or not enough to touch his other achievements, He's best off directing action sequences along dark gritty characters in the mix. I'm really tired of seeing a plot of where all resources on the planet runs out and humans have to do something to find somewhere else to go. YAWN! why don't they make some giant prequel that leads on to another movie to where we make contact and relations with different species of aliens that have different cultures from one another. Make a galactic space opera !",

This film doesn't have the same going for it. The concept has been done and done again. Rather than riding on a gimmick or original idea, this film's success rides on everything else: acting, screenplay, cinematography, etc. It also helps that everyone thinks so highly of Nolan. If this were by another director most people would just yawn. I don't think it will be anything special, but it would be great to be proven wrong.",

There needs to be more of the crew of the ship - with out spoilers. Check out GRAVITY, the trailers showed enough and didn't spoil anything. If there was a grade scale I would give it an F.",

    "commentText": "Yeah... The plot/story sound kind of generic, but I'm sure that what we're seeing here is just 1/3. Nolan was quoted saying that with this one he is honoring 2001, this one looks more conventional than that but it's the director of Inception we're talking about (ability to take generic plot and inject interesting concepts and ideas into it). I know it's early but cinematography looks gorgeous, i was kind of skeptical since he's working with new DP in this one but Hoytema is more then a fine replacement, angles, colors... everything looks beautiful but let's not get ahead of our selves. I would love it if this is pretty much all the information we would get about this movie, i get that it's impossible since everyone depends on this one to be a hit (WB gave up two of their major franchise's just so they could get a cut of the cake, two major studios WB and Paramout are together in this, Legendary pic. bowed out of Man of Steel just so they can finance this one, how much this one earns will in my opinion define Nolan's future career since TDK films and Inception had all batman hype around it, if this one is indeed what Nolan claims it to be and is really that popular it would mean that Nolan is to stay and that more 'not so dumb but kind of emotionless' movies are on the way). I can't wait but I'm kind of afraid since the last time i had huge hopes for a Nolan movie i was kind of disappointed (The Dark Knight Rises... you can't really say it's his fault but Man of Steel too, and big time...)",

Looks like they're going with the theory of bending space around the ship as opposed to propelling the ship itself. Just look up warp drive on google. It's theoretically possible, and I'm guessing it would look a lot like what they did in this trailer. Or, you know. It could just be a wormhole, i guess...",

The issues I can see on the trailer is earth is running out of food due to some natural or man made disaster involving massive dust storms similar to those of the Great Depression. The line \" the world doesn't need anymore engineers...... we ran out of food\" is small reference to the fact that IRL the world is running out of farmers. The government is sending people to other star systems to look for habitable worlds. I can see the use of hypersleep, some kind of space traveling device that bends space-time most likely an Alcubierre warp drive. I'm excited to finally see a movie about the potential, adventure, and discoveries of the first interstellar travel by mankind. Something I feel is the most important issue for the future and survival of humanity.",

If I can't trust him, I don't think I could be able to bring myself to the movies at all. In Nolan we trust.",

It seems as if it is another movie about man-kind prevailing, while throwing space into the mix. I also am not a fan of Matthew McConaughey. I really hate every movie he has been in. I haven't seen his recent works so I bare that in mind. Many times before have I watched other than stellar trailers with outstanding movies and I hope this is one. I was a big fan of The Dark Knight Trilogy and Inception which are the only Nolan directed films I have seen, but as for this trailer, I don't quite see what the hype is about.

Not only does he depict the most realistic future apocalypse with climate change destroying soil and producing dust bowls, but he is giving us a realistic glimpse into real theoretical interstellar travel. This man knows no equal when it comes to truly inspirational a moving tales. As was so eloquently said decade ago, he is \"inspiring the imagination of a generation\".",

The system works best in the private field where the strong companies prosper and the weak fail and show what not to do. ooops I am getting way off track again. sorry.",

The majority of it will take place in space, travelling through a wormhole to investigate a distant planet in search of a solution to Earths problems. Based on the script there are a few scenes to rival if not top anything seen in Inception. The scene travelling through the wormhole sounds especially mindbending.

It would be such a cool film.Sci-fi/Exploration/Adventure/Political Thriller.Not the typical \"aliens invade earth to exterminate us\" plot.Someone pleaaase make this happen!",

Anyway, I don't believe humans can run out of food before discovering the technology to sustain everyone. We just need to get rid of money, religion, & other useless stuff, so we can focus on the most important things to furthering mankind's existence. All-in-all, I don't think it'll matter if we all did just die on this planet... we kinda think that we're way too special. As long as it isn't from Earth exploding, nature will do just fine without us... there are tons of life at the bottom of the ocean that can exist in space, heat, etc. They'll eventually, most likely, evolve into some other being like us billions of years from now.",

If we run into the problem of critical food shortage, and we very well may, a more prudent solution would be to apply vertical farms. There are nations out there building them today. (Sadly, none of those nations are America.) We wouldn't wait until the problem has created a global dust-bowl dystopia then send a single crew to another planet. That solution, while it makes for pretty visuals and an entertaining, if silly story, is asinine. I encourage people genuinely concerned with global food shortage to check out vertical farming, and particularly a book written by Mr. Diamandis and Mr. Kotler entitled: \"Abundance\". I'll see this movie in theaters, but I'll bring my own grain of salt.",

Pretty to look at, and it's trying to be deep, but it is pretty cliche at the end of the day. Obviously we don't know for sure either way till it comes out. Oh well, glad it's going to make a lot of people entertained. ;) [2 cents deposited]",

Nolan is just whipping his dick out now. Smh. 1) The timing for this movie is way off. The characters look like they live in a very near future, BUT the technology being used to travel through black holes is not even close to reality. 2) Humanity is converging and things like stopping the population growth would be acted on way before there was no more food. Plus science will grow food way before humanity can travel long distances through space. Smh. 3) In the future when humanity might act on such a desperate decision, THEY as \"we humanity\" will not resemble a person today. Biology, science, transhumanism, the singularity will all transform the human race. THIS IS A SILLY MOVIE, but it will probably have some cool ass scenes though :)",

Also NASA has estimated with a warp drive compressing space in front of the craft and expanding it behind the craft we could travel to Alpha Centauri, the nearest solar system in 2 weeks to 2-3 months. So in all likelihood the space travelers in this film would come back from a successful trip relatively soon.",

This trailer is absolutely perfect -- it doesn't give too much away, but it showcases the characters and a glimpse of a very intriguing story plot. I hope he can deliver, and I hope this movie makes us question humanity's place in the universe, and the power we have to change for the better.",

I have not a doubt in my mind Mr. Nolan is going to knock this out of the park. The man is a visionary with a mind for creating plots that cause you to question everything when he has given you all the answers. With that stated I did not like this at all. Dust storm and moody music... Ummm ok. If this were the same trailer directed by Michael Bay (Transformers) the \"like\" bar would look like a fully smoked cigarette",

We make the mess, then we want to leave to #2: make the exact same mess in a new world. Accept it. The human being will always be greedy, voracious, careless, selfish, no matter where it goes. We have it in our genes. The first thing that we'll do in another planet is look for gold, then pick the best place, make frontiers, and prohibit anybody else from getting to those resources. Humanity has no unity because we can't share, we want it all, and we'll always consider ourselves worthier and better that the others.",

For all of you that might not know, the faster a person/object/thing however the fuck you want to put it, the faster one reaches closer to the speed of light, time begins, you can say to slow down and everything around you speeds up. All in all, lets say a year in orbit of black whole passes, they get out return to earth, it is now 200 years in earth years; everyone would most likely be dead but here is where they will begin their task of repopulating earth, happy ending blah blah, blah blah...Looking forward to it though, like how they are using science in this, sci-fi is my shit ;3",

I call it growing up and I figure we should start seeing this shift 20 years from now.",

I know the latter wasn't great, but it had all the style and far-out plot of I was expecting. Interstellar doesn't really feel too special. Hopefully, Nolan is saving the best and only showed the exposition of the movie and the bulk of it actually takes place in Space (with some sort of cool antagonist.)",

Science shows that Earth will eventually run out of the resources we have come to depend on to sustain life. So what do you do?

As soon as McConaughey popped up, I yelled \"shhhh\" in the buzzing theater and everything went quiet. I stopped eating my popcorn, and a beautiful two minutes ensued... This movie is going to be the best of 2014, I can feel it. It has so much going for it. Nolan's craft and perfection with his movies is like no one else's; his unique style will be breathtaking. (He's already warned theaters that the sound design and output will be like nothing else before.) I can Interstellar winning 10 Oscars next February including a second consecutive Best Actor for MM. I will be in Boston at the time of this release and I hope to attend a big midnight premiere! I won't be sleeping much come October! The excitement is here!",

Firstly, Alpha Centauri is a part of triple star system, Alpha Centauri A, Alpha Centauri B and Proxima Centauri which happens to be the closest star to our solar system and is about 4.3 light years away, that means it takes 4.3 years for its light to reach our planet earth. Light year in simple words is the distance light can travel in one year. So obviously it'll take 4.3 years to reach Alpha Centauri at the speed of light. The speed of light is 186,000 miles per 'second', if you do the math you'd probably figure it wouldn't take 300 years for us at speed of light. Unless you mean to say with current technological advancements, we could reach by 300 years then too wrong it myt just take us 70,000 or less years. Because so far we were only able to achieve a mere 0.005th the speed of light.",

I think his best movie, by far, is The Prestige. There are many who love the Dark Knight trilogy, well, I did love the second one, but I think the third is a true No-no. There are movies worse than this but there are lots of better ones. I kind of enjoyed the first hour but then it gets so disconnected, and so illogical. I know that this is a movie, that I have to suspend my disbelief, but there are so many mistakes, and predictable calls, that in the end I was totally bored. Loved Insomnia, though. And am I the only one who thinks Inception is not the masterpiece everyone wants us to think? Anyway, I hope this is more like his first movies, and not like his last ones.",

Then, having been a pilot (with no apparent experience as an astronaut), he's the man to fly on a spaceship whose mission will somehow save the Earth from this unexplained doom.

Most likely this is to push the overall message of seeing what humanity will do in its final moments to save itself. Push it too far into the future and we become easily capable of moving planets and the tension won't be nearly as high. Still, it looks like they are making some cool-looking ship and tech concepts for the movie.",
