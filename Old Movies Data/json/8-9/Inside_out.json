    "commentText": "Riley's Parents (from inside out) both have brown eyes and brown hair. For Riley to have blonde hair and blue eyes her parents would both have to carry recessive genes and both pass on only those recessive genes. The likeliness of this happening is very slim (6.25% chance). Also when the movie starts we see Riley's mom holding baby Riley. Her parents appear to be standing up (and her mother looks nothing like a woman who just gave birth) as if Riley has just been handed to them by a nurse. This is obviously Riley's first encounter with her parents. Also Riley's mother is wearing a pink v-neck t-shirt and not a hospital gown. Because of theses reasons Riley's mother is probably not the woman who just gave birth to her. So, who is? Riley's name is Riley Andersen. Bonnie's last name (from toy story 3) is also Anderson (there could have been a family dispute about the spelling of the name which is why they spell it slightly differently). Andy was a little irresponsible in collage. Him and his girlfriend weren't as careful as they should have been and Andy's girlfriend gets pregnant. Andy and his girlfriend then decided to give their unborn child (Riley) up for adoption. While Andy and his pregnant girlfriend were looking for a nice couple, Andy discussed the issue with Bonnie's mom (because the families seemed to be rather close). Bonnie's mom then recommended her younger brother in law and his wife as potential adoption candidates (Riley's parents as seen in inside out, who look a lot like Bonnie's family). This wife was unable to have children and would be more than happy to adopt andy's baby. This would explain Riley's resemblance to andy's mom and Molly and her adopted parents resemblance to Bonnie's family. It also has been confirmed that andy's house, Bonnie's house, and sunny side are all located in an unnamed tri-county area in CA. Although it's obvious that Riley's family moved to San Francisco for her fathers job, her parents also could have moved there to be closer to family (Bonnie's family). In one memory Riley is seen playing on the playground at sunny side (the only difference is the slide but the playground could have just gotten a new slide). So she obvioudly visited California when she was younger and Bonnie's mom (her aunt) could have brought her to sunny side for a day. Another reason why we know that Riley is in the same area as the toy story movies is (this one is a bit of a stretch) at Riley's school a blue eyed brunett is seen where a scull shirt similar to Sid's (who grew up near Andy and became a garbage man for that area). This could be Sid's daughter or niece. Also, in Up Ellie is told she can't have kids. This could be genetic. Ellie could be mrs Anderson's (Riley's mom) aunt. Ellie would therefore be related to Bonnie's family through marriage so Bonnie's mother and Ellie could very well know each other. This would explain how Andy also knows Carl and Ellie and why he has a post card addressed to them.",

In each of those movies, there's the one character, (Joy, Carl, Woody, Marlin) teamed up with a character they don't like so much (Sadness, Russel, Buzz, Dory) who set out to get back/get to somewhere or something (Headquarters, Paradise Falls, Andy's house, Nemo). It's the same thing, over and over. I respect some of Pixar's other films, such as Brave or Monsters Inc., but this... not really. I definitely wouldn't call this ''original''.",

We only think Inside out was predictable because after the fact it seemed formulaic in terms of narrative structure, which to the bare bones yes it may have been, but in detail it was a very creative and original movie, as opposed to Marnie which, yeah, it was great, but Oscars have already been awarded to hand drawn Japanimation style, and whole \"feels\" thing is something we are used to by now.

Oscars are a really big deal, and it seems like every single year Disney wins in the animated film category. Last year, Ghibli's \"The Tale of Princess Kayuga\" lost out to \"Big Hero 6\" The year before, \"The Wind Rises\" lost to \"Frozen\". Ghibli movies tell a story that just sticks with you. The music is beautifully composed, the characters- well, Disney is a lot better when it comes to characters and personality, but either way, Ghibli does such a good job with their films, and it's a shame they've only won once.",

It wasn't a bad film, but I felt that it did very little new and that Disney had created far better works in the past. In comparison, The Wind Rises was a beautifully crafted farewell to Hayao Miyazaki and it's an absolute crime that it didn't win the Oscar. There's even less justification for Kaguya not winnning. A 100% on Rotten Tomatoes and considered by many to be one of the best animated films in years, it should absolutely have won. Big Hero 6 is good, great even, but why would they give the award to the film INSPIRED by Japanese animation and not the actual Japanese anime itself? I think it's just more proof that the Oscars are largely ignorant when it comes to animation. Same thing when it comes to foreign films. There's a lot of great Japanese films that I'm pretty surprised didn't make the nomination in previous years.",

All your comments just increase this. To say something is \"too American\" happens a lot in the UK (and in France) and is normal. The very fact that you responded with adolescent rudeness shows that American cultural norms are the only ones that you know. If you did know others, you would NOT have responded as you did, consequently you have no idea how and why you have shown yourself up. The very fact that you comment a lot on Youtube, daily, (and more than that), shows you are some kid with not much of a life and no friends. You also have no idea what using the words \"cool\" and \"awesome\" say about you, and it isn't good.",

LEAVE THE MEMORY BALLS ALONE FOR GOD'S SAKE! why on earth does she keep tampering with the memories?\\ does sadness represent depression too? bipolar / clinical depression is dangerous BUT! I.

I was blown away by it's depth, and authenticity to the human experience, by it's music and character. And now, despite the newest film The Good Dinosaur not offering much in it's trailers, I have no doubt it's going to be spectacular. Can't judge a movie on it's jacket, I suppose.",

If Bing-Bong survived and did make it to the Headquarters with Joy and Sadness, he might cause problems...such as: (Bus Scene) -Riley seeing her imaginary friend again... -She would freak out first, but as she knows that she lost her family and friends, she became his friend again... -She stays in the Bus because she knows since she has a Friend, she doesn't need her family/friends back... -She would then live the life of a Missing Girl and search for a new Home... -Riley would develop a Disorder called Schizophrenia... -Emotions think Schizophrenia is useful because Riley can do what the Emotions tell her to do through a Mic... -Schizophrenia would then control the Headquarters and the bring in some new friends...Depression and Anxiety -These Disorders would then work along side with Schizophrenia... -When the Bus reach it's destination, she goes hitchhiking and is exposed to drugs and violence... -She used all her money to buy some cigars and meth to calm herself down from the Disorders... -She then develops a Drug Addiction and would do whatever she can for some... -She would then be kidnapped by a Child Predator -She would then become his slave for Drugs... -And after years of torture/rape, she would be found by the Highway as a Jane Doe... Also if a Children's Movie Character dies then it would make a \"good movie\" because it has a \"good reason\" why he/she/it has to die. I showed you one and just telling you, Bing Bong should be forgotten. Have a good night sleep tonight.",

(No spoiler here, they were all introduced in the trailers.) The filmmakers may justify that they need to limit the characters but Desire is such an important emotion to be left out. Desire, drive, or passion helps in steering our thoughts and actions. Desire can be an unruly emotion that often lands us in mischief if unguarded, but it can also be a driving force for us to achieve something if we just channel it positively. What if there is Desire in Inside Out? How would they draw him/her? How would the story go?",

    "commentText": "I look a lot of people asking if there emotions inside of emotions. Well, yes, the most probably thing is, yes. Here's my theory: Emotions doesn't feel always like their names. For example: Joy doesn't feel joyful always, like when she was on the memory dump, she was not joyful, she was sad. When Bing Bong dies, every time an island falls, she wasn't joyful. And also, when she and Sadness were in the subcontanious, she was afraid. Also sadness. And if you take a little look to the movie, the emotions not always are like they are supossed to be. So like the emotions are not always acting like their names, that means that they have anothers type of feelings. So the emotions have emotions, with have emotions, with have emotions, with have emotions, and the circle will never end",

I do like traditional 2d animation aswell, but I think when kids say animated, they think of cgi these days, its just the way the times have gone and in fairness, it takes just as much work if not more to make a beautiful cgi world and character as it does to draw and animate them by hand.

It's like genes, and she will probably develop female ones later in life, after puberty. Puberty is also about finding yourself (what if one were to turn out transgender, you need gender options). It's logical, because she is not yet fully female.",

Just because a film has \"Disney Pixar\" assigned to it doesnt mean it has to be super happy.. I'd say this film is a family film aimed towards kids around Riley's age.. not kids.",

I want to see if anyone else thought It isn't about 5 basic emotions but a complex network of human feeling, And how the film presses on the sensitive topic of mental illness ; showing it in a very amicable light. It isn't something to be shied away from but should be understood by everyone. It should be accepted as an imbalance of emotion beyond our control and sympathised with rather than criticised. Might be an over-analysation, but I was reading some pretty ignorant comments and felt the need to step in. Anyway, snaps for Pixar n disnay",

It was the first computer animated film in 1995 and TS remain the perfect use of CGI animation to date! it also gave birth to a whole new era of film making. The film is about things, fundamental things, like loyalty, family and getting along with one another. personally I'm a huge fan of Tom Hanks and Tim Allen who are the voices of Woody and Buzz, they make the perfect duo. Not to mention that Toy Story used familiar childhood icons from the 80 - 90's generation. So for me it has that nostalgia factor. It's creepy, funny, exiting and heart melting at the same time. TS is about toys that come to life when their owner is asleep or not in the same room! how can you hate that? Let's be honest here have you even seen it? or is it too vintage for you to even give it a shot?",

I made a lot of nice friends and had a lot of fun.I made almost all of my good memories there. Instead of hockey, I've developed an eager passion for soccer. I've played peewee soccer for about a year, and it was pretty fun to meet new people on the soccer team. We lived there for about 12 years, until we took an unexpected turn and moved to Korea. At first, I was excited, but i was also sad for having to lose my friends that i've known for a lifetime. I tried to keep positive, but things took a serious downhill overtime. As soon as school started, I was all alone. The people there were mean and racists. Soon, I starting to get depressed, lonely, and even had some suicidal thoughts. One time, I couldnt take it anymore and spent about a month on getting plane tickets and escaping to Canada. But i knew i couldnt do it, so i just decided to stay in Korea. Is been 3 years now, and I've lost my passion for soccer, lost all self confidence, and have depression, anxiety, social issues, and lonliness. I'm 15 now, and have lasted 3 years in hell. This is why i can connect to the movie \"Inside out\" so much.",

        "commentText": "+Jimin Yu (Jimbob Jimmy) I could also relate to this movie in the sense that I moved away from \"home\" when I was 13. A new city, new school and new people. I never really made any friends, not any worth keeping anyway, and it was an extremely lonely and confusing time for me. I'm 23 now, still living in the \"shitty\" town I moved to at the age of 13... But I've started to like it here, I've decided to look past the people and focus my love on to the scenery that surrounds my city. I learned a lot from being \"transported\" away from the only safe place I knew, I grew a lot -but this was very difficult to see at the time. In retrospect, however, it's very clear to me that this has shaped me in a positive manner. I would suggest talking to somebody about you depression, loneliness and anxiety. I know it's not easy to open up to people, especially when you feel \"alienated\" to begin with, but you should give it a go. Just keep in mind that you might have to see several psychiatrists before finding the right fit for you. Although I don't know you, or anything else about you than the information in this comment, I know that we're all stronger than be believe and we can pull through. Find a light and start walking towards it, never let it out of your sight, but if it slips.. keep walking anyway, if you bump into a wall you just turn and walk the other way until you find your way out - you can do it. /hug",

Anybody out there identify a lot with the subject matter in this movie? Like just about everything? Kind of sucks when you go with a group of people to the movies and they don't get the same thing you get out of it so you can't really engage in deep conversation about it with anyone besides the funny and sad parts. It's as if people in general will get some sort of buzzkill talking about heavy subjects, like its taboo. Like we just want to keep it superficial. Not often can a movie get you reflecting on your life while bringing out a multitude of emotions that are actually depicted as animated characters. This is how \"Inside Out\" is a one of a kind and truly unique film to me. Yes, children will enjoy it but adults will get the most out of it, surprisingly.",

    "commentText": "INSIDE OUT - MOVIE REVIEW (Spoiler Alerts!) I watch it and it was beyond my comprehension. This movie is so smart, funny, insightful & sad (like, seriously sad... T.T). I think this cartoon is not just an ordinary kids movie, rather, more suitable for grown-ups, especially those who struggling with their own crowded minds. I read somewhere, some psychiatric even try to connect the message from this movie with Autism and Depression. Tough subject for kids cartoon, right? There's one cute character named Bing-Bong, he not even mentioned in the trailer, yet his part is so grandiose & touching. Prepare yourself, Bing-Bong gonna put a big painful lump in your chest & lung while you watch (or can't even). There's so many sad moments in this movie, too sad for kids, yet, I think, it will relieving for the adults. Since we don't have many chance to cry nowadays... Nevertheless, the sad parts is equal with the funny & happy parts. There's many smart dialogue & plot that you can't even point out. Who knows a mind of 11-year old girl named Riley could be that astonishing heartbreaking...? I love Joy so much, and her joy in this movie isn't the ignorant one. She try to be happy all the time for the sake of Riley. So when Joy became sad at the centre of the movie, you really need to grab lots of tissues, FAST. Whoever you are, you should watch Inside Out: Highly recommended, it's funny, shocking, happy, sad, smart & even terrifying in some pivotal parts. 10/10 for Pixar. Love it!!",

Inside Out is a movie that can replace physiotherapy. I'm serious. It reflex on all of the emotions and feels we've had as humans growing up with change. If we could analyze our feelings as individuals within us, I think we could cope better with life changing events. Older Adults- You will be drawn into the movie and you will cry at some point. Also there is a Pixar movie short \"Lava\" before Inside Out. And you will cry at that one too.",

Those movies are extremely beautiful and are still draw by hand. Sadly they are going to close. Because people only give credit to these 3D animations that only kids enjoy. Studio Ghibli movies can teach adults and kids giving them the capability to dream and the harshness of reality. All with the atonishing mind and filosofy of japanese artists. So please give those masterpieces the atention that they need.",

Bright colours, big eyed characters, lots of humour. The Ghibili movies are more adult, more realistic, and not made for the markets that Pixar is. They are definitely more adult than pixar. I would love to see more hand drawn disney again, and it is sad that companies rarely do that now as they aren't as popular, but they are still gorgeous films. Watch Baymax for example-stunning film.",

Studio Ghibli movies can teach adults and kids giving them the capability to dream and the harshness of reality. All with the atonishing mind and filosofy of japanese artists.

    "commentText": "(Spoilers) I looked at DABDA, and Riley goes through it pretty consistently. First, Joy was trying to make it seem better than it actually was, a kind of Denial. Then, Riley got angry with her parents at dinner, her friend, and when she stole her parents' credit card. She bargained (in a certain point of view) with the subway online to get back to her old home. She lost her personality islands, showing signs depression. Riley also lost all emotion when the control panel went black as she was sitting in the bus, showing full-scale depression. Sadness got her off and as she went home, she accepted it (although sad and crying). Later, she seemed okay with her new home. And so, she had Denial, Anger, Bargaining, Depression, and Acceptance.",

They could add new emotions (Tired, Sick, Regretful, Dramatic, Embarrassed) and the problem is that now there is a \"president of emotions\" (love) and she/he goes to the headquarters (OH! I just realized that pun!) and that the little boy and Riley are now dating. The love emotion is supposed to help her keep her love emotion. But love accidentally loses her love feeling and now the team has to get them back together. Just a thought :)",

I can actually pinpoint the moment in which my joy withered and hope seemed lost. There's also \"concrete memories\" and if there is a sad one it changes the mindset of the person. I remember when my concrete memories became sad and I began to loose my faith. I wouldn't say this is a children's movie because of the dark themes it portrays when you really look into it",

If you ever wondered how our mind works and why all our emotions, Joy, Sadness, Anger, Fear, and Disgust are all a mandatory part of life, then this resourceful, smart, funny, genuine, and wonderful computer-animated movie is definitely for you to see in 2D. I loved it because it changed my perspective on what I think about my emotions. 5/5 stars.",

We ended up crying in the first few minutes of WALLE-E (even though we both had seen it before, we began thinking too much and now... the movie is absolutely terrifying). Judge me if you like, but I have severe anxiety problems. First reason why I want to see this movie, the main girl has my name, duh. Then other reason why, is because it seems really interesting to see how this movie is. If two of Riley's emotions disappear, what will she act like, and how will the movie portray it? I dunno, I just wanted to say that, but I am truly happy that the producer//director of this movie made it, I think it would be a good idea to give the younger children these days an idea on what's going inside their heads.",

And director stated that the only reason why Riley's is mixed emotions is due to his own gender biases thinking some emotions just seemed more masculine with others being more feminine. But mostly he wanted more cohesion with the scene so he made the parents' emotions one gender for clarity. As the director said, it's essentially 16 characters in 4 different settings in the span of a few minutes so he wanted the parents emotions to be easier to identify. By having the father 's as male with mustaches and the mother's with her hairstyle, we could easily identify which emotion belonged to who when the scene changed. http://www.cinemablend.com/new/Why-Inside-Out-Main-Character-Has-Male-Female-Emotions-72176.html http://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/93997/why-are-two-of-rileys-five-emotions-in-inside-out-male",

It could also be that as we grow older, our individual characteristics become more ingrained into us, we change less emotionally between say, 21 and 29, than say 11 and 19. Also we have a bit more control over our emotions which could be why they look like the mom and dad, because the mom and dad are a little more in control of their emotions than a child. Particularly so if that child were in the process of big changes like moving, or even more so if that child was about to go through massive emotional and physical (and probably some psychological) changes due to puberty or something similar.",

A twink with muscles, but still hairless. So smooth. Incredibly smooth. A twank on the other hand. Twank is no good. That's a twink and a skank. Essentially a ragdoll, just being passed around from twink to twunk to bear to otter. Wait a minute, wait a minute. What's an otter? Subsection of bear. Still hairy, but where a bear generates his power through sheer mass alone, the otter generates his power through extraordinary quickness, cunning, and skill. That is a lot to keep in your head to maintain a lifestyle.",

So she has anger and fear from her dad (both identical to the ones her father has) and then sadness and grossness (I think) which are the same as her mothers. But then there is happiness who is someone that neither her mom or her dad has so it could mean that maybe happiness is gender fluid or transgender? Or maybe Riley is because she has both male and female emotions while her mom and dad only have ones that correlate with their gender!!? I could be reading into this too much but if I'm right...

It could also be that as we grow older, our individual characteristics become more ingrained into us, we change less emotionally between say, 21 and 29, than say 11 and 19. Also we have a bit more control over our emotions which could be why they look like the mom and dad, because the mom and dad are a little more in control of their emotions than a child. Particularly so if that child were in the process of big changes like moving, or even more so if that child was about to go through massive emotional and physical (and probably some psychological) changes due to puberty or something similar.",

It seems like that they are going to touch on depression, which is always a dark plot line no matter how it's delivered. Also judging by the summary of IMDb, seeing that Riley is moving far from her original home, it only supports my prediction. This movie is probably going to make me cry more than Up or Toy Story 3.",

I wrote off the whole movie just based on the fact hollywood was making a movie that dealt with themes of youth mental health. But after watching the trailer I really think this movie is going to give me feels on so many levels, I'm actually crying watching it. lol As someone who has been dealing with mental health issues their whole life, grew up in the awful Children's Aid Society of London and Middlesex, and has been mistreated their whole life by society because of awful misconceptions and stigma towards people with mental illness, I want this movie to succeed. I'm afraid it wont, and I'm afraid the humour and messages will fall so flat... That being said, this trailer made me actually cry. I actually am crying as I type this. I hope this movie turns out great, it could really be something really cool. I think Pixar is one of the only studios in the hollywood industry that could handle the issue of youth mental health with tactfulness, yet still be humourous. There were lots of moments in the trailer that just made me smile, and that I could totally relate to.",

I'll be honest, while it is a trope that isn't one you see as frequently as you do others these days! And guess what, nothing in this movie was terribly original!! That's not why people are praising it; they're praising it because of its creativity!!! And the moral wasn't too much of a common cliche, why you ask, because it wasn't presented nor applied in the same fashion most of these tropey fantasy films present them!!!! And its never the fault of the writer that you couldn't be attached to his characters, being attached is such an arbitrary sentence, you could claim to be attached to a speck on the wall!!!!! And calling someone mature because they had the same nonsensical and biased negative opinion as you, isn't very mature*!!!!!!!* But I will say that +Godrocks1998 is being pretty immature. Your opinion is your own, just don't tote it like fact.",

Something about the emotions and the mind in the form of a children's movie just excites me, the point that really gets me is when Joy says \"You can't always focus on what's going wrong! There is always a way to turn things around!\" I think that is very important for us, as adults, to teach children. This whole movie is a fantastic idea and I hope they do it justice!",

Like when you see people doing something that could be considered \"disgusting\" - like maybe littering, bullying other people, treating animals cruelly, etc. Disgust is what tunes you in to the fact that that type of behavior is, in fact, disgusting, and would thus keep you from behaving that way yourself. And as shown in the film, Disgust is also what lets us know what type of behavior is acceptable in different social situations.

After that, while it may still be a really fun movie, there just isn't much more for you to discover or dissect during a second viewing. So yeah, Inside Out was the exact opposite of that. BTW: It's actually PG. But I get your point. I've long defended that just because a game is rated E or a movie G/PG, that doesn't mean it should just be discounted as children's fodder. Most people who try so hard to prove that they're adults are nothing more than children in grown up bodies themselves. True adults can accept and enjoy quality art when they see it. They don't care about how mature it makes them appear. Pixar knows this, Nintendo knows this, Studio Ghibli knows this. Not a lot of others do.",

If you seriously don't want to pay to watch this movie, at least wait until it comes out on DVD and Blu-ray so you can at least watch a decent bootleg. Which you shouldn't even need to do because most libraries stock these movies within the first few weeks of release. Not to mention Redbox and Netflix-style style streaming and rental services that let you pay a fraction of the ticket/DVD/Blu-ray price to watch the movie after its theater run. I don't advocate piracy, but I see the appeal if it's a movie you don't want to contribute to. For instance, I waited until I could rent Frozen from Redbox to see it because I didn't want to contribute as much to the massive ball of money Disney was raking in from essentially a music video that wasn't as innovative as it was made out to be AND had already made an insane amount of money. But Pixar deserves this success. If you're raving about how good this movie was, at least say thanks with a couple of bills.",

Especially when I feel that they deserve the success they've had, Justa G. On the contrary, I'm curious. Out of the 100's of people who worked on this film, how many names are you familiar with? The director? Producer? What about the countless other people who toiled for 6 years to create the film out of pure dedication and love for the craft (oh yeah, and money). I highly doubt any of those people are riding in limousines to premieres or living in mansions. And they are especially not millionaires, that much is positive. No, you're referring to the faces you see, which make up very little of the large group of people who make Pixar films a reality. And as for the faces of the studio: the phrase, I believe, goes \"from humble beginnings...\" It's not like those people didn't work for what they have.

This means that your eyes have two chromosomes, one from your mom and one from your dad. It is possible for a brown eyed person to carry the blue eyed chromosome, and if both of Riley's parents carried this chromosome, there would be a 25% chance Riley would have two brown eyed chromosomes, a 50% chance she would have both chromosomes, and a 25% chance she would have 2 blue eyed chromosomes, in which case the recessive blue eyed trait would appear.

    "commentText": "Okay, so I'm excited for this movie. I think it's definitely very emotional and deep if you're open minded and can interpret things on a deeper level. So Sadness seems to be the main emotion that nobody really likes, although Joy tries to be friendly. So when Joy and Sadness get lost, Riley mostly feels Anger, Fear and Disgust. In my mind, I think this shows that when people are so down they try to block out a certain emotion, such as joy, love, sadness, etc., these emotions almost kinda get lost deep inside you, causing your other emotions to take over instead. For instance, if you're broken hearted and you block out the emotion of love, then when another situation comes up where somebody likes you, then you're angry because you don't want to get feelings, or you're fearful because you think they'll leave or you're confused of why they even bother to acknowledge you. So blocking out one emotion enhances your others to take over. All of them together can balance each other out. You need them all. I think that's what this movie is meant to portray on a deeper level.",

UP silenced the entire theater within the first five minutes.... I know you guys have the potential to make something even better even without the gimmicks and I think the only thing holding you back is the fear of not being recognized as a \"children's film.\" Personally, I don't think that would change anyone's opinion about you guys.",

Really? The voices in our heads should now have their own personality and gender? Is this the message to the children that go and see the movie? I thought that our human emotions come from within the same personality, not many other different personalities and genders within our mind. What the heck are they trying to teach our kids?! You can put a cute cartoon to any idea and try to make it appear harmless, but it is still a destructive message underneath. Something's wrong with this picture.....",

    "commentText": "Ok, I really want to see this. Not just because of the original story concept, but to see how Joy and Sadness work off each other. Also, I'm really curious to see how they justify being sad. From the looks of the trailer, it seems that Joy is sort of the \"big dog\" in Riley's emotions and Sadness just wants to feel as important and special. When she touched one of the core memories, I can't help but think that maybe it was originally a sad memory, but then Joy made it a happy one, so that when Sadness touched it again, it took on it's true form. (Something like that, I don't know). Really, Sadness is the only emotion that's sort of hard to defend. Joy is obvious because happiness is positive energy. Fear stops you from doing foolish things (i.e. you don't run out into traffic because the thought of being hit by a car is a scary thought. Common sense, I know, but it's linked to fear). Anger, when controlled, can actually be a confidence boost and make you want to stand up for what you believe in. Like being angry against a bully. Disgust...well, I guess disgust can be like fear where it stops you from doing stupid stuff and can lead you to wiser choices. But Sadness can be tricky. I mean, no one LIKES being sad, unless it's a stress relief to cry. Anyone care to comment? (Not trying to star a flame war. I'm just curious to see what people say.)",

As an interesting note, this is the first Pixar film to be rated PG not for rude humor, but rather sensitive subject matter (I dont think thst's the right phrase used, but something that is in essence that). Drugs likely won't be involved, but I do feel like the movie could get pretty heavy.",

With Joy and Sadness gone, the only emotions Riley is capable of strongly feeling are Anger, Disgust, and Fear. So she ends up acting on those emotions' presences, and that likely gets her into trouble. Not to mention Sadness can turn happy memories sad on accident, so Riley could get more and more depressed or unstable if that happens. I even saw someone on TV Tropes guess that if Sadness turns more happy memories sad on accident, Riley might try to attempt suicide (though I highly doubt Pixar would go that far). Also, at least according to the Disney Wikia (this may have been added by oneone who saw one of those hour screenings, idk), but if those edits are true, Riley is somewhat neurotic and one of her dislikes is being called a freak or a psycho.",

You'll notice it more when Joy and Sadness travel deeper into places like Imaginationland or the yet to be revealed Abstract Thought which looks like a Picasso type world.

Plus it's from Pete Docter the director of both UP and Monsters Inc. Then again if you look at Pixar's past trailers they do sometimes make the movie look a little dumb (this one didn't). For example if you watch the first trailer for UP you could've easily thought that the film was just going to be about a man tying balloons to his house. You didn't know you'd be crying in the first 15 minutes. Another example would be the trailer for the first Toy Story. EVERYONE thought it was going to bomb and be awful now look at it! It's a masterpiece! Heck! Even people thought WALL-E wasn't going to be good because the trailers didn't have any dialouge from the main character. Basically what I'm saying is just because something looks dumb and unentertaing doesn't mean that it is dumb and unentertaing.",

Their all desperately hugging to escape their conflict. It's so touching. Even if it was for a couple of seconds it's really emotional. I can't wait till the movie comes out in the next few days. And side note, to everyone who is saying that it is just a scene of a family hugging, no it is not. It's something so much more. You just don't appreciate the cinematography and time code of a movie, or in this case a trailer. I despise you and your unappreciated attitude towards the detail of a film.

It's okay to be sad, and you even need it sometimes. Yes, it IS bad to constantly be sad, but if you never are, your body and mind will never get the chance to sit back, relax, and figure things out for a while. It's completely natural to be sad. True strength is allowing yourself to be sad since you know you have faith you'll get better, and you'll likely learn something about your behavior, the behavior of others, what constitutes as moral, etc. My main emotion almost all the time is extreme joy and happiness, but it's true that it's healthy to be sad. (In all honesty, the one emotion I see all the time that I don't understand is anger. It always seems to lead to somebody's harm instead of helping.People say it gets rid of stress, but why not choose some other outlet for it instead?)",

But then they create great films and give them terrible sequels: Shrek, Madagascar and even HTTYD 2 was visually amazing but so predictable. I'm not shocked Big Hero 6 won the oscar because although it too was predictable, it had that emotional level that HTTYD 2 lacked. I mean did anyone care when hiccups father died? I didn't. But that being said there are some original films that were terrible as well. Films like Shark Tale, Over the Hedge, Flushed Away and Turbo all made me wish I could get my 2 hours back. With Disney there's less of a risk. They very rarely have flops. Their sequels also suck but luckily Disney don't have many of those.",

Then there was the villains. On one side we have a crafty mastermind who, when he sees an opportunity, steals Hiro's devices to get revenge over the loss of his daughter vs a man who enslaves dragons so he can be more powerful.

OOOO the villain actually turns out to be the supposedly \"good guy\".. So orignal.. and Hiro could have just invented a jammer to block all the microbots since hiro is such a genius.... Drago wants to enslave dragons because they killed his whole family/ village, took him arm, and they basically tore him apart. So drago wants revenge. And Drago was actually threatening unlike the professor... After watching BH6 and HTTYD 2 again.. I have to say BH6 had the worse villain..",

They should go back to making those types of films.\" Also no. HTTYD is not better than Pixar or Disney's best. Disney has timeless classics on its side and Pixar has Toy Story, Monsters Inc and Finding Nemo. All better films. But obviously that is just opinion. Let's look at hard facts. 1) Oscars: Up (2010), Toy Story 3 (2011), Brave (2013), Frozen (2014), Big Hero 6 (2015). HTTYD was nominated and lost to Disney and Pixar both times. Rango won in 2012 but Disney didn't have a film nominated that year. 2) Highest Grossing: 1st-Frozen ($1,279,852,693), 2nd-Toy Story 3 ($1,063,171,911), 3rd-The Lion King ($987,483,777), 5th-Finding Nemo ($936,743,261). Shrek 2 is 6th on the list and HTTYD 2 is 20th. No clue how far down the first one is. 3) Critic Ratings: Toy Story (100%), Toy Story 2 (100%), Toy Story 3 (99%), Finding Nemo (99%), Up (98%), HTTYD (98%), HTTYD 2 (92%). All incredibly highly rated films but Disney is still on top. No matter how you try to argue, Disney are always going to be better.",

And transformers was the highest grossing film of last year.. Does that make it good? NO! Sure TS3, up, nemo, ALL great films. But honestly, no way the best... TS3 was only rated %100 because nostalgia..Still a wonderful film.. And you think critics matter? RT gives the shittiest reviews. They nitpick everything. And half of the reviews are from Fake, shitty critics that give terrible reviews.. Oh and since you're mentioning reviews.. HTTYD 2 got better reviews than BH6.. Which is a Disney film that won an oscar.. HTTYD is my favorite animated film next to lion king.. And yes, usually disney make better films than dreamworks.

The story and animation were both generic. If one would watch it without prior knowledge about the animation studio, i guess many would say that it was a Dreamworks film. I don't wanna discuss about the death/s of BH6 and HTTYD2 but the latter had more impact for me. The villain in BH6 had no development at all, it's like they put him for the sake of having a villain since it was a superhero film. Okay, there was at least but it felt so rushed, underdeveloped, yeah. Also, the movie failed to focus and balance Hiro and Baymax. I'm not saying that Hiro was also underdeveloped, but he had no like that spark to be remembered at all. One would not even remember the movie itself but Baymax. Unlike in HTTYD2, they balanced the two, Hiccup and Toothless. They're both memorable both individually and as partners. But overall, Kaguya-hime and Song of the Sea were better films hahaha.

        "commentText": "+Boo Boo \"everything was so predictable. The story and animation were both generic. If one would watch it without prior knowledge about the animation studio, i guess many would say that it was a Dreamworks film.\" So you are saying that DreamWorks do generic films... Let's ignore that, I know the animation was better in HTTYD2 but the movie overall was much weaker. As for predictablity... They were both predictable. DreamWorks always has the long lost family members making appearances in their sequels so I knew Hiccups mum was bound to show up. Just look and Shrek or Madagascar. As for the pack of Dragons being found and therefore threatened... That's basically the plot of Rio 2. As for Big Hero 6, I knew the bad guy was obviously the professor but I had no clue why. That kept me trying to guess the entire time. \"I don't wanna discuss about the death/s of BH6 and HTTYD2 but the latter had more impact for me.\" Losing a loving brother over a dead beat dad is always going to be more painful. I mean Hiro spends the entire movie trying to get over it. Hiccup is over it by the next scene. But even the death of Baymax at the end was tear worthy and he isn't even a living character. \"The villain in BH6 had no development at all\" Um are you kidding me? Callaghan was a scientist who worked on creating teleportation with this corporate fat cat named Krei. One day Krei wants to test out the device before Callaghan feels it is ready but Krei insists. Callaghan's daughter is the test subject and obviously the project fails. Callaghan blames Krei for this and vows revenge. He spends his time as a professor, putting his mind to good use and waiting for an oportunity to get his revenge. At the science show a boy named Hiro presents him with that chance. It is a simple revenge story with a cool twist that we (well clearly not us per se but most kids) thought he was dead, only to find out he was alive this whole time. In getting his revenge he not only almost killed several people and did kill one of his most beloved students. He was so blind to his goals he never noticed the people he was hurting. Then in his final scene where the police are taking him away he sees his daughter is alive meaning he truly was in the wrong and you see that on his face. They put a lot of thought into this character. Much more than the dragon enslaver dude who was just wanting more power. That was a total one note character. \"Also, the movie failed to focus and balance Hiro and Baymax.\" I disagree completely. The relationship between these two characters was amazing. I still fist bump people and go \"fa la la la\" afterwards because of this film. Hiro alone is this amazing child genius who can create pretty much anything he sets his mind to and Baymax is this big, loveable blob of cuteness who wants to help people. I'm not saying Hiccup and Toothless weren't a great team but Hiro and Baymax are just as good. \"But overall, Kaguya-hime and Song of the Sea were better films\". Didn't see either of them but I'm sure they weren't. I love anime and I've seen and own more than I can count (It is currently in the 100s). But Anime films usually lack when it comes to story telling. They start off strong but will fizzle out by the end. Their ideas and animation are outstanding but the actual structure of the story is lacking. Not even Studio Ghibli manage to be strong the whole way through and those films are considered the Disney of Japan.",

The entire time I was watching it I just criticized it with my sister. I guess it just wasn't for me. Big Hero 6 also had those annoying lame supporting characters. Like, in the book they were all Japanese but in the movie they're different races in order to provide for diversity and representation and crap. They all have one dimensional personalities as well, maybe they'll flesh them out in the sequel? The supporting cast in HTTYD were far superior even better in the sequel. So and so that they didn't even feel like supporting characters but rather like actual people. Baymax and Hiro had a good relationship. Even though Hiro is the only one with self awareness. Also BH6 kills off a character early on so it kind of gets forgotten later on. HTTYD2 does it in the middle, adding to the obligatory drama portion of the movie. ALSO, the characters in HTTYD2 were far more likable. The ones in BH6 were either all too smart or too rich for me to get down with. I guess maybe that was it's target audience but I didn't like it. While HTTYD was more for me. I used to be an honors student myself until I realized what terrible people most smart kids were. And no I'm not gonna get into that.",

        "commentText": "+Angelo Cruz No I didn't cry over any of these deaths. I know some people are too emotionally involved in films and cry but I'm not. Except Mufasa (I'm not made of stone). But you act like I barely knew Tadashi and therefore I shouldn't cry over his death. I knew he was the eldest brother of two, who loved and looked out for his little brother. As their parents died while they were young, Tadashi had to step up and try be a good male role model for Hiro. He was a smart, hard working boy who wanted to use his knowledge to help people and make the world a better place. He had a loving aunt and kind friends who thought the world of him. He was clearly a good person and was taken from this Earth too soon. Hiccups dad whose name escapes me (googling it) Stoick is a terrible father. He thinks his son is worthless to him unless he is a warrior. He puts all this pressure on Hiccup to the point where Hiccup is risking his life just to impress him. I mean the dragons could have killed Hiccup a dozen times in that film (the first one). Sure they turned out to be good but Stoick doesn't know that. Stoick is also never around to raise Hiccup. No that is left for Gobber to do. Gobber I might add is the only one in the entire village that believes in Hiccup. He raises him, lets him go through training and isn't completely gob-smacked when it turns out Hiccup can be of use to the village. If they'd killed off him then I'd have been upset. Plus Stoick risked his life every day. Not to sound totally heartless but he had lived a full life by then. Hiccup is 20 in that film (the second one), putting his dad in his 40s. That is a long life for a Viking. As for the supporting characters, cmon. You honestly found that there were any dimensions to the ones in HTTYD. I mean there was the pretty girl who might as well think our hero character is invisible, the jock rival who is obsessed with said pretty girl, the fat dumb one and the twins who can't get along with each other. I get HTTYD is very beloved but it was so cliche. I however didn't mind that because the relationship between Hiccup and Toothless is so good but please don't act like the other characters mattered. As for not liking the changes made from the BH6 comics, did you care about the changes made from the HTTYD books? Trust me, HTTYD isn't even close to its book counterpart. At no point do you forget about Tadashi's death. The entire film Hiro is grieving over it. Even at the end he doesn't want to lose Baymax because not only is he Hiro's friend but the only part of his brother he has left. He can't left go of him but knows he has to. That was the real tragedy. Again, Stoick may have died in the 2nd act but it was almost entirely forgotten about by the next scene. Hiccup was too concerned with losing Toothless because he loves that dragon way more than his father and so he should because Toothless, unlike his dad, has always been there for him.",

        "commentText": "+dragonrings14 I was talking about the kind of animation Dreamworks does. There are lots of CGI movies that are the in the same, more or less, quality of animation in some Dreamworks film. So it was not the whole movie itself. Weaker? It was predictable and cliche but to say that it has a weaker plot compared to HTTYD2, I have to disagree with that. There's much more character development in HTTYD2 compared to BH6. That's the thing also, they just like put something to justify something without any development. It makes sense but it's not an unusual thing nowadays. I know that they both did well emotionally but it still subjective. You focused on one statement alone. Okay, for me it still pretty cliche to the point that it's not surprising nor have impact to me. And I doubt about putting a lot of thought into his character tho. It isn't that complicated for an amateur writer to think about it. Clearly, as i can see, you're just focusing in a certain sentence per paragraph that would make my comment unjustifiable. In HTTYD2, both Hiccup and Toothless are remarkable as partners and individuals. In BH6, they are both remarkable as partners. Baymax, individually, yes but Hiro, I doubt so. That's what I'm trying to say. Again, i said it as my opinion. Heck, i did not even tell you to like it at all. Anime films lack in storytelling? If that's your opinion, I respect that. But I think i have to discuss this more. First, Song of the Sea isn't an anime, it's an Irish animated film by Tomm Moore. It has a better plot than the two above and better storytelling. I have to ask what kind of anime do you usually watch? Of course, all animes are not perfect. There are some that's not really good. For me and many others, animes are great cause they can still hold the premise and improve it more as the story moves on, character development, even side characters are given importance that you can hardly see on its Western counterpart, etc. The \"premise-strong, end-fizzle\" type of movies? Those are mostly Western movies hahaha. They don't usually have focus or get lost with their plot. Could you please suggest me some animated movies that have the same or can even surpass the emotional impact that Wolf Children and Grave of the Fireflies gave? Nice thing that you brought up Studio Ghibli. Your last sentence was kinda disturbing. Are you trying to say that Studio Ghibli are nothing compared to Disney? And it's like it's not worthy to be considered as \"Disney of Japan\"? I like both animations but to say that SG isn't strong as Disney isn't \"acceptable\" lol. Financially, yes, SG has no match with Disney, but with quality, even though I like the two, i can say that SG is better. They both deliver touching movies but Disney is a more straightforward, a very child-friendly one. For me, it is SG that is more emotional because of its subtlety. The characters are great, Disney is more to Man vs Man while SG Man vs Nature vs Self. The settings in Disney are just mere settings. They give so much attention to their settings which they are really famous for. Every landscape evokes different emotion their, part of their subtlety. Storywise, Disney is more straightforward and because of this, sometimes, everything felt rushed and also most are cliche. SG is a slow-paced one. Other people find their movies sometimes in the second act as tedious but it's not something that you can call as fillers. All the wait are really paid off at the ending. Disney's endings are the happy ones. SG sometimes are happy endings when it comes to their more children-oriented films. Their more matured ones vary and sometimes not the happy endings fairy tales showed us. Disney films are children-oriented shows that can be enjoyed by the adults. Studio Ghibli caters not only the children but the adults also. One more thing, the beauty here is that because of SG's subtlety, different age groups have different interpretations and can evoke different emotions to their films than to Disney which is straightforward (I think this is my third/fourth time to say this lol), good for some nostalgic weekends. And last sighs, many say that Disney creates animated film for the sake of entertainment art whereas Studio Ghibli creates films as pieces of art as a whole. (Sorry, it's a mess I know. I just finished a test today that's why my brain is a mess now. And I'm sleepy hahaha)",

        "commentText": "+Boo Boo Holy crap that was a lot to read. But I will simplify it down to 3 points: 1) Big Hero 6 was a better film than HTTYD 2. But it was a very close race. I mean they both grossed roughly the same, are rated roughly the same and have numerous awards. It is basically like saying which of two $10 bills do you like the most. At the end of the day you have $20. Personally though, Big Hero 6 created this story about a 14 year old Asian-American whose bother (and best friend) dies so he clings onto Baymax, the only thing left that reminds him of his brother. That alone was better than a guy tries to take over dragon country by forcing dragons to obey his alpha so now Hiccup has to stop him. If this was the first HTTYD film it would be a bit harder for me but based on the second film it is obvious that Big Hero 6 is the winner. 2) I actually watch all kinds of anime. I have no particular taste unlike most Anime fans. I love it all. I just feel a lot of movies get lost in their story sometimes. Japanese story telling is very different to Western story telling. We prefer happy ending when the Japanese prefer sad ones. We are very black and white about good and evil but Japanese are very grey. It has a lot to do with our history, our legends, our religions. It is too much to go into but I feel the western execution is usually more satisfying. Not every time obviously but a lot of the time. 3) Studio Ghibli and Disney are both great.I could argue for hours about why Disney are still better though. I've seen every Ghibli film and not one of them would beat Lion King. Though some could come close.",

        "commentText": "+dragonrings14 1) Box office hit can't justify the quality of a movie. You are talking about the premise of both movie and i can also agree that BH6 has a better one. But even a promising premise isn't enough for a movie to be great, it's in the execution and progress of things and for me HTTYD2 did a better job. I'm not saying that BH6 did a poor job, it's good, satisfying esp for kids but not to the point of getting the attention of all ages. Like for me, it felt rushed after Tadashi's death. 2) May i know what are those movies? I'm not really a big otaku so I don't know and haven't watched other anime films. That's the thing, cultural biases. If you think it's less satisfying because of those reasons, it still can't justify that it failed on its execution or storytelling. Satisfaction is subjective thus it does not reflect the quality of the movie. For example, I am satisfied with the Transformers but overall, it's not a great movie. And what West lacks is most of their animated films are/were not courageous enough to give their audiences a bad ending. They are good but instead of pushing through the boundaries, they safely play inside the comfort zone. Minus the Pixar tho. One thing that I did not like about Pixar, let's say in Up, was the first act was so great until it became a comedic relief with talking dogs. But still, a great film. 3) You just said that you haven't seen Kaguya-hime and there's When Marnie Was There so no, you haven't watched all of their films. Of course, none could beat Lion King. It has its own merits but it's the same with saying has Disney given us films which has the same quality of Spirited Away? How about Grave of the Fireflies? The characters in Disney are either good or evil. Good wins over evil. Happy ending. That's the formula Disney uses all over the years. Studio Ghibli is much more realistic when it comes to their works. Characters develop because of the setting and its interactions with the other characters. SG's stories are much more compelling, thought-provoking. They justify how the closest antagonists they have become like this. They do not produce movies for the sake of entertainment alone. But at the end of the day, it's a matter of perspective and preferences. To sum it up, if Disney is a storybook, Studio Ghibli is a poetry.",

Yes I grew up with western storytelling but I've been watching anime since I was 5 and real gritty anime since I was 13. I'm quite well adjusted to both stories. Japan does amazing stuff, just usually not in their films. Their stories are always so much more complex and should be padded out into a series. That is why most anime is more than just one movie. Ever seen a series that was a movie first (or vice versa). The series is always far greater. 3) You know what I meant. I've seen every other film except that one. Studio Ghibli have some great films. My favourite is Spirited Away and not just because it was the first one of SGs I had seen but because it is a classic. Grave of the Fireflies is depressing and a tad too slow for my taste. It drags on a bit too much. A bit like Ponyo. Ponyo drags on a lot longer than it needs. There's a reason most films wont go 10 minutes without dialogue. People can be artistic but not at the cost of good story telling. Plus Studio Ghibli's artistic shock value lasts one film. After that, the animation factor lessens.",

I think it is overrated =/ ‚úå 2) it isn't just a culture thing but you can't deny the fact that it affects how we perceive things. And what type of movies and endings you are used to. As I have said, it's a matter of preferences. You may find it boring but not to everyone. And also, some anime films like One Piece's, most of them, if not all, were not canon. 3) Those were all your opinions about those three films. But about the reason? Culture thing again. West are more to action-packed and fast-paced movies. They are made to entertain everyone. Entertaining and simple as it superficially, but in a closer look, it felt rushed, characters underdeveloped, and it leaves too many plot holes. Japanese are more slow-paced which might be boring for the other people, esp in West. But everything's really well paid off example of that is how developed their characters are. And about story telling, West are more into telling, not showing. Most of the time, i felt forced to feel this certain emotion because the scene told me so. And West puts only certain parts in their movie where it should be emotional then after that, they're back to the fast-paced scenes. East, on the other hand, is more on showing not telling (in case of Studio Ghibli). They show you what's happening. It doesn't force you to feel this way. It's like they let their viewers to be free. Everything is subtle. That's why Studio Ghibli is more on a poetic style and more considered as art films why Disney as the bedtime storybooks and more inclined to entertainment.",

They didn't vote for the Ghibli's films cause they had never even watched those films, even the Irish film Song of the Sea. The decisions were full of biases and not very professional. It showed their ignorance and stupidity cause why are you going to vote in the first place if you hadn't watched the other nominees. They may have given the awards to the other films but as long as they haven't watched it prior the voting shit, it will never be the best film of that year. And I'm not saying that Studio Ghibli is better than Disney as a fact. It's only my opinion the same with the other guy's opinion. And for me, a big no. Part of the story in Ghibli is the animation and Disney's animation cannot deliver the depth of the story. I'm sorry but it's only my opinion from observing the different movies the two studios offered.",

Their ideas are what is good.Even Howls Moving Castle, a film I personally hated, had some great ideas. The castle was brilliant, turnip head was clever, and sophies appearance changing as her personality changed was genius. But the plot was terrible. The story fell through in the first 30mins. I felt Kiki's Delivery Service, something with very little creativing, was more entertaining because it was a story. A story about a girl trying to make it on her own. Was it great? No. But it never really tried to be great. Simplicity has its merits too. So to sum up, Disney just help with the story arch and the animation. Studio Ghibli do the ideas and basic designs. Ghibli feel with a Disney paint job. It would be the perfect combo.",

But if you're talking about simplicity, I have to say that My Neighbor Totoro is on the lead in that category. But what made so special was the execution, the development of the characters, the emotional depth of the story/characters that I haven't seen on any Disney films. And the 80s feels, that what makes Studio Ghibli unique. It seems that you don't know about this stuff and I advise you to learn more about the SG because using that argument would show your lack of knowledge about the subject matter. I'm not being rude here but it's true. They're very traditional. They still use hand-drawn animation over CGI. They don't use new technology as a new medium but rather use it to give \"a little boost of elegance\". Imo, Disney's simple, \"Disney-cliche\" stories, songs, etc are the things that made Disney to where they are right now, let alone that they are the pioneer in the animated films, esp hand drawn. But as a lover of both Disney and Ghibli, i can say that the former's animation cannot hold a candle to the latter. Some Ghibli movies were very simple but it's the subtleties on the animation that made the movies so special.",

I know that 18 films is a lot to watch but I've managed 17 of them. Also just because I think Ghibli should update their animation a bit doesn't mean I don't get their films. They don't have to stop hand drawn animation to do this. The Little Mermaid was hand drawn and it was done better that Ponyo, a movie that came out 20 years after. Studio Ghibli can keep their quirky flavour but modernise the look. The 80s feel isn't what makes their company unique. It is what makes it unpopular. Even in Japan these films aren't always well received. Compared to the latest and greatest animation Japan is doing atm they don't even compare. What really makes Studio Ghibli worth watching is their unpredictablilty. No 2 films have ever felt the same to me. Sure this means they have produced so bad films but it also means that you might see the next Princess Mononoke or Arrietty (both great films if you haven't seen them). But with Disney you know you will get a great film. Oh and Disney isn't cliche, it's signature. They are their own style. Can you tell me the last time you were disappointed by a Disney film? Because I can't. I mean people tell me Cars 2 was bad but I didn't see that one. I guess I wasn't a huge fan of Toy Story 2 but most people think I'm crazy for that.",

I question your claim about their animation. If you really know something about the studio itself, you wouldn't question that. And lemme ask you about this, does reading all Harry Potter books will make you the all-it-know Harry Potter geek or let's say, know some trivia about it? No, right. I haven't read nor watched all books and films but i can say that i know more stuff than those who have read and watched it (like my friends, etc). Mark Twain once said, \"Don't let schooling interfere with your education.\" Comparing The Little Mermaid to Ponyo just because they were both hand drawn is absurd. The word hand drawn itself is a broad word, there are different styles to it. If you compare them, why not include Song of the Sea also. It's about half-human and half-seal which is pretty related to mermaids and it's also hand drawn :) It seems that you are equating uniqueness to the success of something. Ghibli is popular in their own credits and one of those is their animation. It's my bad also to say 80s feels alone. I should have stick to the traditional. Have you watched Kaguya-hime? Imagine and compare other styles of hand drawing and even CGI and tell me if they have match against Isao Takahata's use of traditional Japanese way of drawing. I don't know about the receptions of the Japanese about the films. It's purely subjective after all and remember that they have a different way of life than to the West, so maybe, culture affects it. How can you even compare the different animation style of Ghibli's, let's say Spirited Away to One Piece? Once again, it's subjective. I agree to that but Ghibli's different approach to their animation is what also sets them apart to Disney, etc. Others cannot put the same subtleties that Ghibli usually do. Their animation helps a lot in conveying the emotion of the characters, etc. Don't worry, I have seen them. I can't say i'm always impressed by Disney films. They also have some flopped movies. Cliche is different to \"Disney-cliche\" that's why I put a quotation marks there. And saying that it's their own style contradicts your argument against Ghibli's way of animation lol. If Disney can make it's own signature by making their own \"Disneyfied cliche stories\", then why question the different traditional animation approach of Ghibli? Disappointed? Bolt, Frozen, etc.",

If your friends have seen all the films and movies of Harry Potter they probably know a lot more than you. Unless they aren't ones to care about the franchise. But I care greatly for anime and know a lot more than you are giving me credit for. I used Ponyo and The Little Mermaid because we are talking about Disney and Studio Ghibli. Also both were hand drawn and have under water themes making them a bit easier to compare. Song of the Sea wasn't hand drawn. It was a 2D digitally drawn film much like Disneys films in the 90s. Also because I haven't seen the film I don't act like I know it. I know a lot about Japanese culture. I've studied Japanese, lived in Japan and watch and read more anime than I wish to admit and from this I know one thing for certain... They aren't that different from the west. They are the most westernised eastern country in the world. How this affects movie going? I doubt it does. They want to see awesome movies just like everyone else. I never once compared Spirited Away to One Piece. I said modern animation. One Piece is from 1997 and they haven't updated that style. A modern anime that you have probably heard of is Attack on Titan. That was just visually stunning. No, see you still aren't getting it. You think I want Stidio Ghibli to change its style completey. I just want them to update their animation. I want the quirkiness that Ghibli bring with their drawings and concepts. As for Disney, we are talking storywise. But I doubt they will fall on their \"Disney-cliches\" as you put it. Disney have very rarily done that since the 90s. I mean Frozen and Tangled were meant to be Disney Princess films so you expect those Disney-isms. Frozen was a great film. Sure they needed to cut out like half the songs (5 or 6 songs is plenty and Frozen had like 10) but it told a good story and put a nice twist on The Ice Queen. As for Bolt, I haven't seen that one either. But I have seen Meet The Robinsons, Wreck-it Ralph, Big Hero 6, Tangled, Frozen. All great films and that is just their recent CG films. I know they aren't perfect but you got to admit their success ratio is much higher than Studio Ghibli.",

Everything that happens in her mind has to make some sort of sense because it has to connect with real-world things in a logical way. If done wrong, it could just seem like her mind is insane, or that what happens in her mind has no connection to her real-life actions. They have to create rules for this world that we can believe. If they don't get it just right, the audience could constantly call into questions the rules of the story and think \"wait...this doesn't add up,\" or, \"What's going on, again?\" If they do it well, though, this could be a really thoughtful movie with a lot of depth, where everything happens for a reason and there's meaning in every action of every scene.",

Pixar still is driven by filmmakers and that's what Disney Animation has become a filmmaking studio. Both studios are not run by executives telling them what to make. Yet Pixar made Cars 2 just cause they wanted to (they didn't have to make it cause Merchandising, Merchandising, MERCHANDISING). And what happened?

Sure, Disney's made a couple of lucky successes thanks to John's interference, but I still can't take Disney seriously despite those 'three' good films you've named; Tangled was released five years ago, btw, the same time as Toy Story 3. I mean, Disney is a business-making company, rebooting and rehashing old tales into live action 'darker and grittier' profits, coughing out Direct-to-DVD titles year after year, making an numerous amount of mediocre Disney Channel movies. It's a big company whose brand is just attached with so much mediocrity that I just... shake my head. It's a joke that such a name is attached to Pixar. When Pixar set out to do a movie, when they get it right (which, let's face it, it's 7 out of 10 times), there's usually a pretty cool theme or message behind it that's made for adults, whether it's parental abandonment in Toy Story 2, or giving freedom to your child and let him grow on his own in Finding Nemo, or Ratatouille, a fine art movie that's just about as uniquely made as anything you'd find at the Sundance Film Festival. I think, especially with the case of Ratatouille, comparing Pixar to the Disney brand is an underwhelming insult to the Pixar brand. Pixar's not doing that well lately, but their deeds outweigh their flaws.",

Disney, on the other hand, is just repeating the same thing that they do best - making money, not to mention their recent successes partially being owed to John Lasseter. The Circle 7 deal might be over now, as you say, but I don't trust these guys. I mean, John's moving to Disney instead of staying at Pixar and making them great. If John had not moved over to Disney, I'll bet that those recent Pixar movies you criticised, and those recent Disney movies you praised? They wouldn't have happened, at all.",

Well I guess you should look no further than Disney Animation Studios' past films. Maybe they haven't come out with \"original\" content lately, but in the past they've made films like... (*looks up the list of DAS films) Oh my god. You've totally got me there, dude. I just looked over their list of animated features, and technically, almost every one of them is based on a novel or an existing story or legend of some kind (actually, I think most films are probably based on something. You just don't always hear about it). There are a lot of original films, but it's a small percentage when you're looking at over 50 films. The only DAS movies completely free from any adaptation are segments of Fantasia , Many lesser known films made around WWII times, The Rescuers Down Under (The Rescuers was adaptation though), _The Lion King_ (but there's some controversy about its real origins), segments of Fantasia 2000 , Dinosaur , Lilo and Stitch, Brother Bear, Home on the Range (sigh), Bolt, and Wreck-It-Ralph. So I guess there's a testimony there-some really great films, and some one better left forgotten-, but if you're looking at a percentage of their films, it's a small one because they've made a lot of films. It's also worth noting that DAS has put so much originality and charm into their classic adaptations (think \"Sleeping Beauty\", \"Bambi\", and \"Robin Hood\") that they have taken over the legends on their own. When people think of those stories, the Disney version is the first thing in our minds. So it doesn't have to be completely original in conception to be \"original\" in execution.",

Disney said they'd have no involvement with the project (just distribute it) and that is how we got Toy Story 2, the first sequel to a Disney film.

        "commentText": "+Boo Boo Sure thing. 1. Typical singular Disney princess protagonists changes to two. One of which is the sister of the other, and one of which becomes a queen. Disney has never had a queen protagonist. 2. We get more of a cataclysmic feel as the main issue could eventually lead to hundreds of deaths by extreme cold, if it remains unsolved. Most Disney princess (not all, but most) have low-scale problems compared to that of what Anna has to deal with. There are some who do have crazy problems like her (i.e. Mulan), but nothing else like this. 3. Soundtrack is nothing short of a masterpiece. Every song was notable, some of which got stuck in heads everywhere for a long time. 4. Two unpredictable plot twists which leaded to a more lovable ending for everyone. Not only with Hans' betrayal, but with Anna's sacrifice. We all assumed she was going to kiss Kristoff after the kiss with Hans wouldn't work. But that's not what happened. 5. First Disney princess/queen to posses magical elemental powers. Which, I might add, are also dangerous powers belonging to one of the protagonists. Never happened before. 6. First time the main character sang a love song with the villain. A very catchy, well thought-out song. 7. Have you ever seen a character created from magic that was a memory from the creator's childhood fun with their sister? Seems pretty un-clich√© if you ask me. 8. Certainly one of, if not THE most unique Disney princess we've ever seen. From her awkwardness to how she wakes up, she's definitely the best princess we've had in awhile. DEFINITELY not clich√©. 9. And finally, a Disney movie that teaches the importance of familial ties through a sibling relationship that has a GOOD reason not to be recognized. Luckily, as Anna taught us, these reasons are largely outweighed by true love.",

They are absolute and strictly what they are designed to be i.e. angry, sad, scared. One illusion you are presented in this trailer is the emotions have feelings because they have personalities. Really their personalities are what define them as emotions. A sad entity can't be sad unless it behaves sad. Does that clear this up? :)",

For instance, when a typically sad Sadness initiates an action, of course the kid will feel sad, but whenever Sadness is happier than usual (as we can see, she does smile a few times in the trailer), or if Joy sometimes happens to feels down while she's at the commands, then exactly what emotion does that come out as ? Do they kind of cancel each other, or mix together as maybe some kind of nostalgic longing ? Unless the emotions' emotions simply have no effect whatsoever on their human host as long as they keep pushing the right buttons...",

        "commentText": "+Faunatik You bring up a very valid point I didn't consider at first. It's easy to argue that Pixar wanted the emotions to have their own emotions, but in a more deeper philosophical level, does the sadness emotion exhibiting happiness affect its decision making? That is the core question because if it does affect its decision making, then it is valid to say the emotions have emotions because a sad emotion would never put the human in a position to be happy; that is a fault of definition. This I think goes along with you saying they need to push the correct buttons. Unless each emotion is parts of other emotions with a dominant emotion. Then every emotion is swayed more to a certain kind of decision, but is still likely to choose one not reflecting its dominant emotion. What I mean by that is for example: happiness is 50% happiness emotion, 25% sad, and 25% angry. So the happiness emotion is more likely to choose a happy decision rather than a sad one. I think this is the most plausible but would refute them being absolute. They still would be defined by their personalities, however, since their decisions are swayed to a dominant decision type. If sadness emotion exhibiting happiness doesn't affect it's decision making, then what they are showing is just part of a personality. We will have to watch the movie to find out. And great response btw!",

        "commentText": "+K-Town Thanks ! You come up with some very interesting explanations yourself. :) I think you're right about the main question being to what extent the emotions' effect on the human's behavior can vary in intensity (or even in nature) depending on their own mood of the moment, and whether or not those inconsistancies within themselves might influence the way the primary emotions they represent will be received and expressed by the person under their control. I also like your hypothesis that each one of those characters is mostly an incarnation of one main emotion (like Joy), but is not limited to that single trait only, which could explain why despite having only five basic emotions, the little girl is still able to experience many other feelings (like guilt, confidence, empathy, etc.)",

I have the perception that about 3-5% of the people in my country know all the teams of, at least, US professional major sports (NBA, NFL, MLB and NHL) and especially popular teams like San Francisco's.

It's not the executives that make a film, it's the artists and tons of people behind the scenes at the Pixar studio. They put all the hard work and creative effort into the movie. Therefore, it's still very much a Pixar film as it's solely coming out of the Pixar studio, which does not work on Disney Animated films.",

        "commentText": "+DexDacozed I think the purpose was to simplify it as much as possible, since this is a family move aimed at children. Yeah, Joy doesn't cover all the possible positive emotions in the real world, but it you were the one making the movie and were told to pick the 5 emotions which needed to be portrayed, you couldn't really say \"Okay, I want happiness, pride, confidence, excitement...or, and let's throw in a Negativity\" because while the 4 positive ones I listed can be boiled down to Joy on a theoretical sense, Sadness and Anger and Fear and Disgust are too different from one another to be combined without sacrificing something (namely the consistency of portraying each emotion with roughly the same emotional range. In other words, they probably only have one positive emotion probably because you react the same way to most positive emotions fairly similarly (smiling), with minor differences coming in for more exact types, whereas the other four are completey different (crying and feeling down for sadness, fuming and loss of control with anger, nervousness and heightened instincts for fear, avoidance and...mild nausea for disgust, maybe?). It's not to mean that we have less positive emotion, as mentioned above, just that there's a lot more range to cover for the negative ones than for the positive. On that note, though, this is a movie which centers on a (pre-)teen girl, so it's not unrealistic to have her have a lot more negative emotions, being as hormones and social factors do make modern adolescence very moody fairly often, which is why her mind is more chaotic than her parents', who are already out of the adolescent stage and therefore have a better grip on their emotion most of the time. I do get what you're saying, though. I do kind of wish there was a higher range of positive emotions to feel, but the film makers had to go with what would make the most sense in comparison to a ultra-simplified version of the real world. Have a nice day/night now, and I hope your Joy is working overtime to bring you lot of positive feelings. ^_^",

Joy - Provides happiness and spontaneity Sadness - Gives you emotional depth and the ability to counteract the sometimes overly-free nature of joyDisgust - Allows you to dictate your likes and dislikes and form opinions Fear - Makes you think on your feet and avoid dangerous, or somehow threatening situations. Anger - Provides expression and passion against/for something, gives you the confidence to stand up for yourself and what you believe. The Ideal, in the world of the movie, I think, is to have all five working in harmony to feel an entire spectrum of emotions, and be the best person you can be.

But hatred is what killed Hitler. Sure it's mostly associated with bad things. But Love, people only associate with goodness, but the Love some people have for their god/religion causes mass genocide. Don't you see, there are good and bad things about every emotion. When you feel Joyful, you dance around and feel fantastic, and you make rash decisions to continue feeling joyous and happy, and those rash decisions cause us to \"get lost\", or end up in bad relationships, or trust people we shouldn't, or make bad decisions with drugs and alcohol. All of those are connected with Joy and Pleasure. Emotions are neutral, it's just how and when we use them, that the connotation arises.",

I only took one semester of psychology, but I did study that. I'm guessing they didn't include surprise because it didn't work with the story they wanted to tell.

Even though this animation looks good and it has a high rating, the characters still look familiar, a lot like most of the Pixar characters, their behavior and joke-like and fun-like (because they are not funny) attitude is the same. They like a lot of drama, but still they do unnaturally happy-cheesy cartoons: with dancing and a bloody joyful aura, with fatty, well-fed characters (although this one is slightly better than the most), too vibrant colors, and the scenario is always too bloody obvious. I know it's for children, but old Disney cartoons had more sense and children could get them, and it's not like the new generation isn't smarter. Again, this one is alright, but Pixar doesn't always know a shit. They usually suck big time and to me they are old news, unless their style and stories develop for real. The company should be way better with the money they have, but not really, because they are all about the commercial purposes and can't make a real art.",
