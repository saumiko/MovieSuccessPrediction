Pleasantly wrong. So captivating that it draws you in, concentrating on everything the child is saying about his perspective of life. I don't cry in movies, but I balled my eyes out like a baby throughout the whole movie. Oh, my goodness. Great Movie. So much emotion and tears.",

This trailer gives away the whole movie, which could cause some to not watch it, because they already know what is going to happen, that they get free. I'm glad I didn't know anything about it, because I was captivated so much I was balling my eyes out throughout the whole movie. I'm still emotional about it a day later, and probably will be for a while. That's how great this move is. It draws you in, especially the way that Jack describes his world, both in the Room, and outside the Room.",

The day the cops surrounded his house and we found out had he had a woman and a girl in his basement, well... that was a surprise. Bernie even helped out with the neighborhood watch, from time to time. Didn't really talk, he just helped wave a flashlight around and took notes. Guess it's the quiet ones that have... well... abductees in the ol' basement. The new neighbors are a vietnamese couple with a couple kids. Pretty sure they don't have abductees in the basement, now.",

Not only for the production value but of the way the actors would have to convey the characters. Needless to say, I was not disappointed. The movie is as heartbreaking and surprisingly uplifting as the book. I still recommend reading the book though, as it is an experience like no other and I couldn't put it down.",

Though this movie is trying to be more about adapting to the world after their escape it is no excuse to show that part in detail. Just imagine you saw this trailer and then watched the movie with the scene where old Mick is driving in the red truck or even the scene where the boy is in the police car trying to make them understand the desperate situation. Those scenes were built up to be very intense and suspenseful. The emotional effect of those scenes is downgraded because you know it's going to be a success all because of this stupid trailer.",

    "commentText": "I went to see 'Room'. it is a harrowing film which depicts the painful story of a captivity. For me its a film about coming out of captivity and how people react to something they cannot relate to. It had smacks of true crime cases such as the 'Ariel Castro' case and the 3 girls held in his house and a child born to him within the 10 years, and also the 'Josef Fritzl' case who abducted his own daughter for 24 years by design and incestuously abused her resulting in her having... 7 children to her own father. The themes of 'Room' touches on so many ie the bond between mother and son and its strength, how the child does not know that there is a real world outside of the 4 walls and has never felt rain or sun on his skin, sexual abuse and molestation, reuniting 'with world', fitting in, heroism, courage, the media, the family unit, isolation, depression, resources, imagination, the power of play, the power of language, what freedom means, perception, relationships, the police and how they handle or don't handle these kind of crimes, the recovery process and many more..Powerful film that will stay with you long after you have left the 'room'.",

I was utterly convinced that grandpa Leo would be involved in it all, since he had a dog. The ONLY dog in the film. And what did the kidnapper use to kidnap \"Ma\"? A DOG. Overall, it was a good film with some impressive acting. But I thought it would be a thriller, and not a story about coping with extreme personal and emotional trauma.",

I have listened to this song almost once everyday for 3ish years. I had no clue that it was used in Room. I just saw the movie today because I have just finished the book. The scene where Jack escapes, the song that is playing in the background is mighty rio grande. So i listened to the same piece of music that the movie used when i was reading that scene. Without even knowing. For those who have scene we're the millers, my reaction was the same as Jennifer Aniston's when the cast trick her in the bloopers with the friends theme song except, instead of laughing and having a good time, i was in tears.",

It will not depress you, but surely will make your heart cry for the predicament of the captive lady. In the same time the film will impress you with the little boy's discovery about the world from a completely different point of view. The academy award for Best Actress was well deserved. Pace of the film might seem slow but the scenes changes and the dialogues aren't prolonged but realistic, which would keep you engaged with the film. I really hope films like this are made every year.",

I only wished I felt the same way after seeing the Revenant. Anybody reading this post, under the same conditions as DiCaprio would have done just as well. It's not acting if you're actually miserable. DiCaprio could learn a lot from Larson.",

    "commentText": "Brie Larson deserves the Academy Award for her work in this extraordinary film. Her performance as 'Ma' was captivating and heartbreakingly good, and believable. This is one of the best films I've seen in a long time and the way that it portrayed the unbreakable bond between mother and child was incredible. Jacob Tremblay was also amazing, I mean for a 9 year old to be able to convey that kind of emotion is nothing short of spectacular.",

If they just starting screaming at the top of there lungs someone could hear them! I can not believe people are actually saying that this movie is amazing! When the guy took the kid out in the rug the door was literally wide open and she just stands there?! Naw, the more effective strategy of getting out is to have your kid play dead wrap him up in a rug then have the guy drive off with him!! Seriously WTF?!!! I can't believe I just waisted 2 hours of my life watching this awful movie!",

The brilliance of the director i felt is not in the mystery of what happens to them but how it happens, and its that experience of that process that is absolutely genius!! That is why he/she almost reveals the whole plot here without fear. This was the BEST movie i have seen in years!",

Such a shame it's going to Stallone for a performance that wasn't good enough before, so now it's a pity nomination and most likely win. Even though Jacob Tremblay or Idris Elba should have won! Fuck sakes even Christian Bale could be on Oscar number 2 but nope. It's going to Stallone. Jacob Tremblay deserved an Oscar nomination for Room.",

I saw this movie before watching the trailer and I hope that's what other people do, too. When I left the theater, I didn't know if I wanted to cry, hyperventilate, laugh, meditate, vomit, or sleep. Room is a unique and rare theatrical experience. Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay deliver transformative performances that will draw you into the film—into their traumatic reality. I hope everyone sees this film in theaters!",

I happened to hear someone mentioning this film and I just brushed it off, not realizing what it actually was. It's nice that they made it into a film, but it feels like they make everything into a film nowadays. The novel felt like a really personal and little thing before and now it's this big movie. It just feels a little funny,",

If you haven't seen the film yet then firstly GO SEE IT and secondly SEE IT BEFORE YOU SEE THIS TRAILER!!!",

    "commentText": "Interesting trailer. Can anyone tell me, about how much of the movie is spent in \"the room\" and how much is spent after their escape? Because the trailer seems to imply that the majority of the movie is devoted to their escape, recovery, and healing. If so, I find that particularly impressive. Typically, your \"abduction by bad guy\" plot line shows capture, lingers over abuse, and only shows escape as the final scene. Issues such as recovery, healing, and lasting trauma from the abuse are often ignored because they don't fit into the sort of simplistic tension-climax-resolution dramatic arc moviemakers are used to. But by centralizing the abuser I think such stories give abusers more power and attention than they deserve. There ought to be more movies where the abuser is not centralized but rather the story is about the victims and how they rebuild their lives and become survivors afterwards. That's where the real story is.",

Not only does it straight-up tell you everything that happens, it somehow does this without really showing how the movie feels, ie. that the whole story is expressed primarily from a child's POV. This makes it look so goddamn conventional, like a shmoopy Lifetime movie. Blah The movie is fucking amazing tho. I was totally demolished. I haven't been blown away by an indie like this since WHIPLASH.",

I'm still watching the films awarded during this awards season but i KNOW FOR A FACT that nothing can top this one.

You go through the concern of whether or not they will ever escape, the terror of what might happen to Jack during the attempt, Jack's fear when he doesn't know whether or not Old Nick killed his mother, and then finally the movie's larger question of how both mother and son will be able to handle the world. If you go into the movie knowing nothing about the book but having watched the trailer, those first three questions have already been answered for you. Yes, there are some great emotional scenes in the first half, but plot-wise, it's a countdown until the escape. For the viewer who knows escape is coming, the stakes can't possibly feel as high in that first half. It doesn't mean that someone who watched the trailer first can't enjoy the movie. It just means that there is a more satisfying ride in store for those who haven't.",

I also didn't know if the captor would go back and assault the woman really bad or anything like that. I think it might be because I kept thinking throughout the movie that cases like this actually has happend for real and all of them didn't end up with this happy ending..

It's such an emotional and moving book, I hope the film lives up to it's expectations, but judging on the comments it seems as though it does!",

At the begining I was confused to why Joy was stuck in this room with her 5 year old son, in the begining I thought she was paranoid and wanted to lock herself away from the world, and that she was maybe poor. I thought old Nic was just someone shed have sex with and he'd give her money. Turnt out to be so different! You don't see many movies like this. It had me in tears. She really did love her Jack. Such a cute kid. A shame her father couldn't look at him, at the same time I can't blame him. It's so difficult. A MUST WATCH!",

Since I didn't watch this trailer first, the scene was so powerful, so emotional and tense wondering how the escape is going to happen, if he succeeds, what will happen to ma and so on.

Without going into too much detail (google \"jaycee dugard\"), Dugard was abducted and kept for almost two decades and was found and freed in 2009 so there is a possibility that the author (Emma Donoghue) may have been influenced by the Dugard case.",

When you want to watch a movie at the cinema you want to watch entertainment, comedy, fun, a meaningful story. Not misery like this. There is already too much of misery in 24hr news, in real life. Misery is different from sadness. This trailer tells me this movie is bleak. And bleakness is also different from sadness. Charlie Chaplin produced sadness in his short films: but they hinted at hope, at life. Misery and bleakness are dispiriting. This movie is complete fiction: so why make it bleak, miserable? This movie is just self-indulgent nonsense - the fact that this type of movie is made is a reflection of our self-regarding, conceited world. Don't be dragged down by it. Don't go and watch it. Could you really watch it twice? Really? (I've only watched the trailer - and the movie does not appeal to me).",

And an enterprise it is these days where evil, wrongdoing, scandal in a sensationalist, media-driven world are all seemingly immediately up for the highest bidder to buy the film or book rights into, via perhaps some so-called other work of art (that might reference an actual event), or actual real-life experience. This kind of reactive cultural enterprising has the effect of trivialising the immorality, the iniquities (where they exist) that are sought to be portrayed. It's like saying, 'Thank you Mr. Bad Guy for being in the right place, at the right time - without you it would not have been possible for our enterprise to win awards and a tidy sum of money.' And the bigger picture of society's malaise is lost - society thus cannot see the wood for the trees. Would an ethnic minority enterprise make a movie with this type of storyline if searching to make a meaningful story? I think it would concentrate on what's important to society, its society. But its society is the majority's, too. We need to make movies that ALL in a society can relate to (not just for self-pitying, white, western middle class). That's why I said this type of movie is made, this Room movie, due to the streak of self-indulgent nonsense (that is a feature of our money-focussed society). And the one-word title is dire: probably so titled because a quick four-letter tap online can access all the 'wonderful' stuff we need to know about it. Take '12 Angry Men': a great movie, with no ethnic minority representation (the original): but one ALL in society can relate to. But UPLIFTING too! There is hope for ALL!",

There's something about that boy, as played by Jacob Tremblay, that just rings true with all his inner wisdom and joy at greeting the sink and the inanimate objects as if they were real, even referring to \"room\" as if it were a living thing. The writing, of course, achieves that type of transcendence, and the directing makes it real, and it all hits home in highly personal and touching ways. It's quite an emotional ride.",

The surprises are in how it's approached, the acting, and even the action, which people might not expect from a film like this. I guarantee this film will surprise you if you check it out. If you only care about what happens, but how, why, when, etc. are meaningless to you, then I guess I understand where you're coming from.",

I've read the book and literally read the entire escape scene leant forward in tension, and they only showed a TINY bit of the escape in the trailer. So people still don't know whats gonna hit them, theres a lot they didn't show. Yeah you see the basics of how Jack got out, but if you've read it you know theres a lot more to it, how they actually went about doing it was terrifying and suspenseful, and I'm sure watching the whole thing play out on screen is going to be great.",

I assumed you were talking about Josef Fritzl's daughter, Elizabeth. That's why I wanted to note the number of children Elizabeth really had (including the child he murdered by refusing to get that child medical care--as it was so incredibly important to Elizabeth, that that horrific act be recognized as the murder that it was, and her child be recognized as one of the children that had lived). If you were referring to something else, I must've misunderstood, so I apologize for my end of the blunder =) But, I do think you didn't make it quite clear that you were no longer talking about Elizabeth Fritzl. Anyhoo, I absolutely agree that the horrific trauma she endured, in the years of rapes before he imprisoned her, and then for all of those years in captivity, with so little space and air, and absolutely no sunlight--is ABSOLUTELY UNIMAGINABLE, as you point out. She is an incredible person and mother.",

I don't remember how long he lived though. Yes, Let's hope they're finally doing a bit better. They have been doing very intense therapy for a number of years. And it's been quite a slog. Its been terribly hard--with lots of painful transition. BUT, thankfully, the upstairs children and downstairs children apparently have finally bonded as siblings and Elizabeth as their mom, and are close. At first the kids were at odds with one another. They now all live together, still in a sort of hiding. The media is awful, so that's made their healing process far more difficult. They are clearly all very brave and strong--and Elizabeth is at the helm, keeping them safe as always. Hopefully they are able to rejoin the world, and have good lives (if not the most normal ones) after a few more years of adjustment...",

Emma did a spectacular job cutting the fat from the novel and shining up the stuff that matters. A lot of the subsidiary characters in the novel (Paul and his inconsiderate, unobservant wife) were removed, the unlikable traits were removed from the Grandma (she seemed very impatient and incessantly annoyed in the novel), and \"Steppa\" became one of my favorite characters in the movie even though he only had a tiny role.",

On the word Help, as The Help was out about 4 years ago. re: Room -- the very rare instance where the movie is actually better than the very good book, for me. It may have been the reduced narration from a 5-year old, as that was wearying at times, in the book. As is standard, there is more to the (8 hour) book than the (2 hour) movie. Other than that, the popcorn munching and paper crackling and coughing in the theater audience is .... ummmm .... annoying / distracting. The soundtrack is rather quiet at times. We';re supposed to be in a small soundproof room with the two principals (Jack and Ma), but it kept feeling like I was in a big movie theater. I am looking forward to seeing it again at home, some day. In the quiet.",
