The screenplay was so poorly written that it turned the lovely characters she wrote about into idiots. If you had read the books and took from them what women will take...Edward Cullen is hard not to fall in love with. Thus, Rob Pattinson brought upon himself the crazed teens. I don't actually think he minds so much.",

I've been liking Taylor for a long time since he featured in Cheaper by the Dozen and he happens to be an excellent actor. When Rob was starred in Harry Potter, not many girls were all crazy about him. But now that he's Edward Cullen in Twilight. Almost every girl thinks he's hot. Now, I find that ridiculous. Just saying. Not all fans are like that.",

I am slightly excited to see the new movie though. I'll just either wait and catch it on dvd or I'll wait until after opening weekend to watch it.",

The theme can always be as mundane as ever (just like in Harry Potter) but the way the writer builds the plot and the tension, or his/her writing style is what makes him/her special. The theme has no bearing on the quality of the wirter. If it were true then Dostoyevsky and Mark Twain would've perished long ago.",

Did the winds change course or did the town of Fork switch geographical locations. I think they might run the risk of alienating a lot of the serious vampire genre fans in a bid to attract the younger teeny bopper fan club. What a Shame!!!",

And just because people are into a book series or movie series doesnt mean that is destroying the youth! Dont be so dramatic! Why dont you go and talk about that movie Bruno now that is just a waste! but twilight is entertaining, and inspiring. It does what most books do, takes you to a world you havent seen before. not everything has to be mindbending!",

The reason I have a problem with Edward is the way he's too protective of Bella. I mean, to the point that he's spilling over into abusive boyfriend territory(not literally, he does have his points, too)",

But ya know, just making a fun trailer doesn't mean it's gonna be loads of fun. The first movie was terrible in my opinion. Then again, the first book wasn't so hot either. I can't wait to see the suck of the last one. I couldn't even get through the entire book. It killed me. >__>",
