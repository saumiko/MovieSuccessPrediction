Though he had almost no formal training in pure mathematics, he made extraordinary contributions to mathematical analysis, number theory, infinite series, and continued fractions. Ramanujan initially developed his own mathematical research in isolation; it was quickly recognized by Indian mathematicians. When his skills became obvious and known to the wider mathematical community, centered in Europe at the time, he began a partnership with the English mathematician G. H. Hardy. The Cambridge professor realized that Ramanujan had rediscovered previously known theorems in addition to producing new ones.",

This is the fundamental problem with religion because if this higher power doesn't exist then you can't really prove that it doesn't exist and it will open gate for people who can made up stuff all the time and convince society to w/e idea they want. Religion is only a tool which revolves around notion that you can control people with an idea that can't be disproved. Even when we know for a fact that those biblical stories about flood and so on are false and even when we know that church lied or was killing people for going against bible and was destroying knowledge because it didn't fit their holy book. Even when know those things for a fact... people still believe because they were indoctrinated from early childhood and scared into believing that you will go to hell if you don;t believe. This is the biggest case of intellectual abuse in the history of humanity. I don't know if god exists so i don't act like he does because i don't know.",

        "commentText": "+J!NXTER The mindset of science is based around it. Test until you find the definitive truth. Humans are not born skeptics and are malleable individuals. We didn't learn to doubt until contradictions appear to us. Science is built around solid evidence which means that scientists are by profession, inclined to be skeptical and it shows when they come upon competing theories. But when the goal is to find the objective truth, the very foundation of a scientific experiment is to eliminate all elements that would result in an inconclusive answer. The process of math focuses on patterns of discovery based upon a numerical system. The different formulas generated by mathematicians are likewise checked and proven by other mathematicians. But since the source of these formulas are born from the human mind, it tends to have no real explanation for many other than divine inspiration. Maybe it is the way they are formed or what was done to reach the conclusion, but the subject of math is a lot like art. You have to pursue the pattern in order to reach an answer. And when you keep pursuing patterns, eventually you start seeing patterns in everything. And odds are, you might have just hit the jackpot on it.",

Sooner or later people want to bend other people's minds to their own will because they believe that what they think is true. Sooner or later one group of people is using believes to gain power over other less intelligent group of people and cults, sects and other similar creations arise. Religion, in general, is breeding ignorance, hypocrisy and distorted view of the world. When children are born they are being conditioned to think that there is no other way but to believe in a god which is an abuse of children. People were literally killing other people and even whole nations in the name of this hypothetical god... People are literally bullshitting themselves into believing into a god to excuse their own actions like christian church did while he was killing people simply because what they believed in was different from other people beliefs. Islam religion is now doing the same thing they kill other people simply because of different beliefs. Here is a FACT - Through human history religion a belief that there is a god caused more death, suffering and abuse than anything else. So why would you even argue that there is nothing wrong in believing in a hypothetical god? Are you that desperate?",

The history of a belief system should not have any bearing on what they do now as long as it is not used again to promote negative ideals. Of course there are plenty of groups that would succumb to zealotry, but there are more in those groups that practice more pious beliefs. Simply arguing for the worse is not an answer when you ignore the best of them. The question isn't \"why are you attacking them\", but rather \"why are you using the worse to describe them all?\" And just to make this a bit more clear to you, I'm a pagan and this entire debate is farcical when you can't seem to grasp the idea that religion need not be organized. Quoting Bran ThaMan, \"There's really no problem in Believing in God.\"",

I don't see people killing themselves over unicorns and dragons but they kill themselves over ultimate lie - GOD. Do we kill ourselves over Norse gods? No. Do we kill ourselves because of Egyptian gods? No. Because we threw those beliefs out and it made us better but then other beliefs were forced upon people and everything went to shit again. Belief in a god caused people to do stupid shit to hurt people to abuse them and that's why it's bad. It doesn't matter if it's one person believing or two or three it will always grow into something bigger and it will cause a lot of bad things. It's impossible to have healthy society where people act on a beliefs toward almighty power which give them excuses to act irrationally. I don't think you can be serious by saying that there is nothing bad in believing in a god in a world where adult individual's \"kill\" their our children because they believe in god instead a doctor.",

It does show a lot about how the argument does have its failings on both sides due to the extremes of their positions. Your entire argument is based around blaming the ideological figures when it is human error and conceit that creates the problem. Where there are people who have thrown in with the extremes of their beliefs, you have taken refuge in the opposite position where you blame their ideology instead of seeing it for what it really is, the failures of humanity. You generally are unable to see the benefits or even the reason for the need for a belief and just continue to point fingers while hiding it behind the veneer of \"reason\". That to me, is just as bad of as falling in with the religious extremists. You also didn't even bother to ask me of my religious beliefs with the assumption that I, having some form of faith is already beneath you in some way. That is in itself a problem that makes your argument weak. But I digress, since I don't plan to reveal my faith to you anyway. :/",

Science can be religious in some senses, but the process of the scientific method is by function, just a professional skillset. It can produce materials that you can believe in, but it in and of itself is just a process of discovering truth through the process of elimination. There is nothing really to believe in science, only what is and what is not. Now believing that the information that science has can lead to a higher purpose is closer to what you are getting at.",

Theories are tested and proven based on evidence and in most cases, while they are not definitive, they are what set the standards for things to come. Modern science is built upon scientists knowing nothing about the subject and everything we have now is transitional. In other words, theories may not be definitive, but they are substantially more than JUST theories. In science, there are no such thing as laws because there are always potential discoveries that may change or build upon existing theories. While treating science as unwavering is wrong it should be noted that science in general is a culmination of what humans have learned from the world, not hearsay made of cockamamie ideas.",

Living there. For people like us, it's the little things. A smile to a stranger, seeing someone trying hard and succeeding beyond measure and appreciating their efforts is what leads people to take those measures in the first place. There's always something you can do. And no matter how small it may seem in the moment, it makes all the difference in the end. That's what I believe anyway.",

These good people absorb other's misery within themselves and try to make the world a better place...the world indeed gets some gain..but the people themselves get polluted from the extreme misery of humanity, and thus die quickly. It is more of a philosophical approach rather than a scientific one. And I'm speaking not only of Ramanujan in this case, Swami Vivekananda (died 39), Alan Turing (died 43), Sukanta Bhattacharya (died 28) also are few great people to live for such a short span on earth",

They usually made very little money which often was less the poverty line. The stereotypical upper class family of 1912, they own a 'large suburban house', the father of the family is a wealthy businessman and they all have high social status. UK has been very class society (upper class, under class, above class‚Ä¶..you never know) Cambridge was a kind of club for upper class society. Mr Ramanujan (R.I.P) was outsider, he was not belonging anywhere. Mr Ramanujan was a genius, very intelligent, unusual talented person; great natural ability, but still very lonely. Cambridge never appreciate him as he was not belonging to (white club society).",

Old, boring, dull, and portraying the false reality on how success could be. If not for the actors and the picture taking, this movie doesn't deserve a big screen. Maybe yes if this movie was released 5 to 10 years ago. Also, for as much as you judge me being a Caucasian, esp with that condescending \"tone\", I could only judge you being a typical stubborn, narrow minded person. Fyi, I am not Caucasian. Whatever my identity is, it has nothing to do with my review. And unlike you (again, I am judging you now. Please stop replying to people's comment if you are the typical I-am-always-right-kind-of-people. You are a cancer), I give opinion objectively as a person who loves to watch movie in cinemas.

Ramanujan was blessed with such capacity. ''The work of that one year, while he was dying, was the equivalent of a lifetime of work for a very great mathematician,'' said Richard Askey of the University of Wisconsin. To be frank, Ramanujan surpassed euler or gauss in terms of mathematical genius which the british hates to agree. He had such an insight which great mathematician can only dream off. Ref - look at Ramanujan's formula and compare it to gauss or euler. You will probably lighten yourself up. It is british who spread rumours that he is one such among other mathematician as he was from a colonized land, India. USA recognised and given him the credit. Back to point - one can write such formulas when the person was guided by supernatural power(what he termed as \"God speaks to me\") in meditation. If you say that \"God speaks to me\" is a danger sign to any spiritual people(people who meditate upon God) in India, then Indians will laugh at you. Remember , only spiritual place left on the planet is India.",

        "commentText": "@Krishna Ra - There is a difference between criticizing people and criticizing a people's uninformed ideals. That is - unless one defines himself or others by their ideals, then - he is offended , and usually offended secretly. Because oddly enough - this person is the same person quickest to resort to dismissive name-calling, such as: ' fool ' or ' ignorant ' , when others cannot accept or agree with their beliefs or ideologies. And oddly enough, he is always the one, the ' open-minded ' one, who adamantly protests for - not only himself, but others not to listen to any type of scholarly scientific/philosophical truth inherently for the sake of his own personal, 'moral beliefs'. :) The so-called paradox of freedom, is the argument that freedom in the sense of absence of any constraining control must lead to very great restraint, since it makes the bully free to enslave the meek. The idea is, in a slightly different form, and with very different tendency, clearly expressed in Plato. ( I am of Greek descent - thus, I have been raised on the Philosophical teachings of our ancient forefathers, and not theological dogma ) ; but - it seems that every fool wants to tell every other fool the right way to live. It's a perpetual epidemic called universal human stupidity, which of course begets INTOLERANCE of other people's ideas or beliefs . You may live in a part of the world where you are NOT free to THINK for yourself nor declare that you DO NOT believe in any deity - however, the world does not begin nor end with India and its polytheistic practices + beliefs. I live in a Democracy - and I am FREE to THINK for myself and not be subjected to believe what my parents/ grandparents/ friends or SOCIETY at large believes. This is called FREEDOM bhai :) You have your thoughts - and I have mine :) ( @ http://bit.ly/Your-Thought-and-Mine ) NAMASTE ( from Greece )",

India has been continuously producing the talents for centuries. We know the worth of Greeks intellectuals very well.

While the Europeans are wasting their time trying to get their union straightened out, the United States is trillions in debt, has a terrible economy and is not looking at much for recovery. The only places that white people seem to be doing well is Canada which is its own thing and Australia, which is also its own thing. Meanwhile, China is basically raking it in and calling shots it never would have dreamed of ages ago, Korea has exploded into the big leagues while Japan just sits on their stable market without a care in the world. You really think white people own this world anymore? Sooner or later, you will realize that the world is very different outside of the bubble that you live in and that for all your pretentious blabber, white people have pretty much stopped being the big dogs in the park.

He did receive some unpleasantness at the hands of his fellow Indians, but that wouldn't fit into your narrative. Read the book, if that's within your skill set, or enjoy your ignorance.",

An Indian mother spends all her life for her kids unlike west where they spend most of their times for career.Since indian mother spends 24/7 with their kids and when she finds a girl from a well known family, why postpone it. Answering your question. A kid can adjust easily in earlier stages into another family. A grown up girl will find it very difficult to adjust. This is why west have more failures in marriage than any other countries in the world. Country / % Divorce India/ 0.08 United Kingdom/ 51 United States / 56. Moral: Learn culture from India!!!",

Remember hollywood affirm the magic affirm the dream there is a god a loving god and we hunger to be deluded tell us what we want to hear, all we have to do is ignore nasty reality and embrace the fantasy of god if we wish hard enough it will be so if we wish upon a star it can be ours. god is great, or, is that simply a mountain of bullshit. let's pray for an answer to that",

But just because there are newer ways of doing things like reading books digitally doesnt mean books are so oudated that they are no longer useful... Imagine what happens to your Kindle or whatever electronic book when an emp blast fries your circuits...the paper books didnt notice a thing. My only point is that the outdated pieces of human evolution have some usefulness still to certain people or situations.

Dev Patel is serious miscast in my opinion for this role and he just shows western random boyish like excitement which we have seen in hundreds of movies to which i could never relate Ramanujam to.",

Actors are often defined by and therefore picked for roles they fit in the eye of the viewer. Want to portray an Indian mathematician, you pick the best/ most famous Indian Actor who seems to fit the role. Similarly if your casting for a kung fu master, your unlikely to pick a redneck from Texas, because the viewer is going to struggle to be convinced by him. I mean sure if you give him some elaborate backstory to explain it it can be done, but there are enough actors out there which fit particular roles to just find the perfect actor for the role. A lot of films are centred on these stereotypes because the viewer finds it easier to accept.",

Be it any race, I will show my disappointment regardless of ANY stereotypical role given to people of colour. It just so happens in this case I was pointing out the fact that he had to play a mainland Indian. As for Airbender he was given a role for the wrong race. The character he played should have been of east asian descent. It just seemed odd and out of place. Same goes for white people playing roles of colour e.g that abomination of a movie Gods of Egypt. I do not like to discriminate but it is always the case that people of colour get type casted. What stops you from telling me how I feel?",

Similarly, if people are casting, for example a british guy, Dev Patel is not gonna be their first pick simply because he is Indian. You wouldn't expect Jeremy Irons to be cast for a quintessentially Indian role would you, it would be ridiculous. Your disappointment in this case ' The Man Who Knew Infinity' is therefore kinda stupid because the guy the film is based off and who Patel is playing is Indian, they aint gonna be choosing a white guy any more than the next James Bond director will be picking an Indian.",

    "commentText": "Srinivasa Ramanujan FRS (pronunciation: Listeni/ ÉriÀêniv…ëÀês…ô r…ëÀêm…ëÀên äd í…ôn/) (22 December 1887 ‚Äì 26 April 1920) was an Indian mathematician and autodidact. Though he had almost no formal training in pure mathematics, he made extraordinary contributions to mathematical analysis, number theory, infinite series, and continued fractions. Ramanujan initially developed his own mathematical research in isolation; it was quickly recognized by Indian mathematicians. When his skills became apparent to the wider mathematical community, centred in Europe at the time, he began a famous partnership with the English mathematician G. H. Hardy. He rediscovered previously known theorems in addition to producing new theorems. During his short life, Ramanujan independently compiled nearly 3,900 results (mostly identities and equations). Nearly all his claims have now been proven correct, although some were already known. He stated results that were both original and highly unconventional, such as the Ramanujan prime and the Ramanujan theta function, and these have inspired a vast amount of further research. The Ramanujan Journal, an international publication, was launched to publish work in all areas of mathematics influenced by his work. source:wiki",

There is no value in exposing all the dramatic challenges in the story, and also show the end scenes in the trailer. That totally ruins the movie. And by the way, I didn't know about this Indian person. It would be a much better experience not to know about him anything before the movie, and learn about him later (for those who don't know anything about him). After watching this trailer, I think I have have seen enough of everything, so why spend my money and time on something that was already shown here? No point whatsoever.",

The Mughals never stood a chance against the Indian Kings' armies. they could only invade a part of the North and soon they destroyed their own empire as the thrones were passed on to future kings with no skill and only rage and hatred for the Indians. Two Thirds of the country still belonged to Indian kings who's fortification was hard as rock and they never let any foreigner invade their lands. As for the British, they held more power and recognition in the outside world than the Indian kings did and had much more modernized warfare weaponry than Indian Kings. They won one single war that gave them the green card into our country. Battle of Plasey. I don't know how it's spelt. Then they entered the country and made Kolkata, one of our major cities, their capital, and slowly began spreading everywhere. They called their government our government and just out of the blue claimed our lands by their laws and took everything away from us. Some of the Indian kings wanted their alliance and power and started paying Britishers and started fighting for them against our own Indian aies who revolted against the British Empire. MILLIONS were killed by the Britishers and by their infamous strategy of 'divide' and conquer. And in those 100 years of their rule, they took our wealth that was worth over several gazillion bucks. Including the famous 'Kohinoor Diamond' that now the British Monarch proudly wears on their crown. The biggest diamond in the world. India was known as the 'Golden Bird' since it was the richest and most prosperous country of all countries, in its time. And after a hundred years of their rules and draining ALL OF WEALTH AND RESOURCES now they proudly bask in the riches of our sweat and blood while my countrymen are still recovering from its aftermath. Don't state your opinions on matters you are unaware of and don't scratch the wounds of people who have suffered a great loss. Even today, we cannot do anything about the grave injustice that was done to us. Because they have all our wealth. They are still one of the most powerful. And clearly, the world know how ungrateful they have been to us. Whatever they are, Whatever they have, is ours and of the several other countries they colonized. Also, if they would have never invaded, there would have been no division between India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Myanmar and Sri Lanka. India wasn't only the richest but also one of the biggest countries in its time. That's what really happened.",

I am not British, but I give them respect for what they were able to achieve, even if it was cruel or unfair, as they say the strongest rule above all.

        "commentText": "+elixzemalius Essentially I'll put it to you like this: the countries you listed are majority-white, and The British Empire implemented immigration from the UK in order to have a large settler population outnumbering the natives. Thus they are more economically advantaged than most third world, non-white nations. It's simple. I mean an idiot could tell you that. You have a larger economy, and a larger affluent elite established in those lands. Stop making pointless arguements you can't win. The way a colonial power treats its subjects effects the future of that subject once independence is gained. That's why the white-majority colonies fair better. They were given very different treatment. The countries you listed are thus irrelevant. A better arguement would have been Nigeria, most of the British Caribbean (Jamaica, Trinidad, Barbados, etc.) and Zimbabwe or even Sri Lanka, Pakistan or other parts of South Asia plundered by the British. Whether it was 'neccessary' or 'the nature of humanity' is irrelevant. As a human being who isn't a complete serial killer or sociopath (hopefully) there's no reason for you to try to justify colonialism in any of its forms. Or try to defend it. The fact is the British did a disservice. THIS IS A WELL KNOWN FACT. and has been preached, printed and proven in publications for over half a century by people, conservative or liberal. The British Empire has so much blood on its hands that it's a running joke. They were just greedy a-holes, nothing more. No intellectual or true historical arguement could be made. They function the same as the Romans, or Mongols, or Ottoman Empire, or French empire, or any other major power in human history. They were monsters. For all the 'civilization' and 'laws' they introduced they also brought rape, genocide, inequality, British-style classism, prejudice, propaganda, theft, socioeconomic and geographic pillaging, stealing of land, murder, and much worse with them. It doesn't matter that invading powers in the past did the same thing, the British had the fire and manpower to do it on a larger scale--thus it was much worse, obviously. That's the point.",

Simple as that. A lot of Europeans struggled cause they were invaded by a stronger force, and some were practically slaves cause of what has happened, so why did we manage to succeed? And not others, you can look at Singapore, Hong Kong, Australia. and not all European countries gained great amounts of resources from other countries just to become rich, far from it! UAE, Singapore, Norway, Austria,Switzerland became rich cus of right decisions from their state and people adapting to them. Some were filthy poor not so far ago or had no real economy, but they managed, which cannot be said the same about India or some other countries. Let me retribute this again, if India has had the same or very similar culture as now as back in the days it means it'll stay a shit-hole. Hey, Norway was a pretty strong country at some point, but cus of some shit it became poor and was taken over, but then it became rich again. It's not the resources, or what happened in the past, but rather it is India or countries like India that is at fault for not being able to implement and enforce better laws and social reconstruction in a more effective way. You can be all bitter about the past, but it will not solve anyone's issues, if you cannot learn from the past and do the correct decisions then you will not be able to progress fast enough or simply fail.",

India got these lands and many development took place because of British. British could never conquer Nepal. Those land belonged to Nepal. Nepal had to gave those land because of the treaty to the british not to india but when british moved back those land still remained in India.

Is that I can garantee that one will come across more speaking english indians in that in china put together!! And is so weird on how connected china and india are with each other!!

I opened myself to the Hindu spirituality and my ways on seeing life is incredible!!! Seeing life nature people in such a inner deeper like manner that I wouldn't have thought on myself on seeing it as. Way before opening myself to its spirituality I made a decision to become a vegetarian. But is through this here spirituality that help me strongly on keeping it that way. And cause of it I'm seeing god nature and life in a way I never thought of. Let put like this I was raised as Christian which I do still follow!!

    "commentText": "Man: I know Infinity Everyone else: Tell us! Man: Infinity (symbol: ‚àû) is an abstract concept describing something without any bound and is relevant in a number of fields, predominantly mathematics and physics. In mathematics, \"infinity\" is often treated as if it were a number (i.e., it counts or measures things: \"an infinite number of terms\") but it is not the same sort of number as natural or real numbers. Georg Cantor formalized many ideas related to infinity and infinite sets during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. In the theory he developed, there are infinite sets of different sizes (called cardinalities).[1] For example, the set of integers is countably infinite, while the infinite set of real numbers is uncountable.",

North India isn't the pinnacle of South Asian progress, but when you say stuff like \"non-stereotypical\" you act like it is. Iyengar changed the game and this is one of the first times South India is being represented at all tbh and it's kinda sad how you equate this film to stereotyping.",

But, i don't understand why people are bashing Bollywood here. Sure BW has its share of chunk garbage movies but films like Neerja and Airlift (both based on real life events) reaffirm my faith that good stories will eventually find their way onto the celluloid.",

Also mathematicians being super resistant to new formulas/theorems is kind of a defining flaw of the field, and its somewhat realistic for them to be hesitant to accept new ideas with proofs to back them up. I honestly think it has just as much to do with the guys' age as it does his race (who's this young upstart with no experience in the field to one up me, a great tenured professor?)",

The best are extremely good and can compete with anyone from west and east. British directors dont have any special gift that others cannot have. They have also made lots of below average films .Actually, I cant think of that many really good ones. Just because a British person make a movie based on the life of an Indian, who many will not know or could not care less for, makes them superior film directors? I dont think so. The wants of the cinema goer in India is different. This kind of film would not appeal to the masses who crave for escapism. Indian directors know their audience. The best have not become extremely rich by guessing alone. TBH, not many will really be interested in the person whose life the movie is based. They will hype it up, and people will watch it.",

This is the reason why we share his achievement and why we feel his struggle. I'm buying his Biography , even better his autobiography if it is available. Our paths and goal may differ, but being born in the same land, our struggles are same. For if it is not within him i can find motivation then where can i?.",

Chemistry is also rehash sht if you don't know. Lastly, considering most of everything is based on what others have done in the past then it stands to reason that everything you do is pure sht as well.

    "commentText": "So glad this story is finally be told on the big screen. Ramanujan was a true genius and used that genius to make amazing discoveries for which there are still conferences on trying to figure out the almost magical insight of this man. He was self-educated by reading primarily a single book...which was a uniquely condensed yet comprehensive text of mathematical proofs Carr's A Synopsis of Elementary Results in Pure and Applied Mathematics. The text is available now on amazon, but was also able to be downloaded for free from the Internet Archive and google books a few years ago. Its a fascinating read which because it doesn't have the fluff that most modern publishers use for dubious reasons of adding unecessary heft for profit, would not bore a budding genius and allow him to reach a new potential quickly. His story really speaks to the fact that there are great people from humble backgrounds who can achieve miraculous things if they have the right education and support. I wonder how many Ramanjan's there are out there thoughout the world who have never had the opportunity to reach their potential.",

They used to have a yearly conference in Chicago discussing trying to proof his many mathematical statements (often without proof). I don't know if you've studied maths to know but it sound like you have not. His formula are really out of this world using continued frations, strange exponentials...and they work, even though they are nothing like we normally use. His work has important applications in number theory which applies to crytography, and many of his formulas no doubt will only have application in the far future when we have the other sciences catch up with them. I fear you question either comes from ignorance of maths or perhaps racism since he was from Southern India which are given lower castes. When I was in India, it seemed there was a lot of racism toward the Soutern and darker skinned castes, which is a real shame since Ramanujan should be considered a national hero. He certainly has done a lot more for this world than most Brahmins or cricket players.",

Whole treatises are written about a a few of his formulats. He was very unconventional and mathematicians of the day and perhaps some now might think because he did not use classical proofs that it couldn't be important...but time has shown this is not the case. He made significant inroads into continued fractional representations and also divergent series, but that was only part of this work. The whole proof thing while important was somewhat blindsided by Godel work anyways, and there are whole schools of mathematical thought (intuitionist) which have some standing. As I said, the other sciences probably have a long way to go to catch up with this stuff and use it to its full potential....even with quantum physics and quantum field theory we're working with complex numbers and integral/differential geometry developed hundred years before Ramanujan.

Find the one 'Indian' guy you know and put him in everything India. The only consolation is that he is at least ethnically Indian, would have been even more shameful if a white actor was cast with brownface makeup. The sad thing is that Dev Patel is Gujarati and niether looks or talks like a South Indian Brahmin like Ramanujan. It's like casting a Vietnamese guy to play Mao bc 'they all look alike'! When will hollywood bother to know that India is diverse and not everyone is Punjabi or Gujarati! When will they care to do the research to potray a Tamil guy to play Ramanujan.",

Not Plagiarising but seeking instead your own answers and explanations from within. Trusting your own instincts and your inner voice from the depths of your inner core, your very soul which is directly connected like an umbilical cord to every human being on earth because the universe connects us all, knowingly and unknowingly, and is the very reason we're all here, to discover it, taking humanity to the next level of knowing and appreciating the true power that lies in us all. Be more self aware and listen to your heart in a quiet room somewhere, without distraction and white noise. Its all there, but are you listening? <3",

Listen...ONLY THE SMARTEST INDIANS FROM INDIAN COME HERE/ IF INDIAN WERE AT THE US BORDER, PEOPLE'S VIEWS OF INDIANS WOULD BE SIMILAR TO THAT OF MEXICANS! LOOK AT INDIANS IN BRITIAN FOR GOD SAKES. ALSO, WHY IS INDIA SO POOR IF THEY ARE SO SMART? EASY ANSWER, ITS BECAUSE WE ONLY SEE THE BEST ONES IN THE US. THE REST ARE MANIPULATIVE RETARDED SCAMMERS! WHITES>INDIANS... END OF STORY. Look at white societies..now at Indian societies. Indians have to flee to white societies lol...but of course, according to you, they GO RIGHT THROUGH THEIR AMERICAN COUNTER PARTS! That's why all the noble prize winners in science are Indian right? And most of the doctor at top hospitals are white... Indian doctors work at small rural hospitals lol.",

Its our own own fault as a country. We don't appreciate our great minds and hence all brilliant minds move to US UK where they are treated with respect that they deserve. That's why we are so far behind.. Nobody here knows the name of even one scientist who were part of the Mangalyan program but everybody remembers who scored a century in cricket.. As a country we need to rethink our priorities..",

A professor at Oxford received a letter, read a little of it, and then threw it in his waste basket, for he was used to getting letters from \"crackpots\" claiming to have solved this, or that... But he had a feeling.. so he took the letter out of the waste basket... and soon realized that it was written by a kid in a village in India, who had stumbled upon a math textbook, taught himself from it, and then.. invented the rest... but what he invented was stuff already discovered by great western minds such as Gauss and Euler and others.. not knowing of what they had done... so he invited him to Oxford to fill in the blanks... In time, he hated his eccentricities, namely his Hindu fatalism - if he got sick, refused to see a doctor, calling it karma, or whatever... Once he was in a cab with a professor who looked at a license plate and said casuaaly, What a boring number. And Ramanujan replied something like, Actually it is an interesting number, being prime... It was like four digits. ... I think he might have made some contribution in astrophysics.. no, not Chandreshkar, but Ramanujan... I don't know... my memory comes and goes.",

From what I see he hardly has the accent of a person in the early 1900's educated in India. Even his mannerisms are very confident. All this would have not been there in a person from early 1900's in India which had little exposure to sources of developing the accent and mannerisms of the west. While his acting may be good it sure does not bring out Ramanajun as he would have been a hundred years ago.",

Most of People in India just want to watch item numbers, romance(but talking about sex is a taboo), illogical impossible actions etc. Good movies rarely make it big here. Because of such audience Bollywood makes those type of movies. Audience in west is more mature about this so that's why they make more good movies. And also they get talents from all over the world but Bollywood gets only from India and that too gets filtered. But it's improving now. We are getting lots of good movies now. Not watching Bollywood movies at all is a stupid decision. You have no idea what you are missing.",

I am partially agree with furmal that Bollywood does make many crap movies also which is of no use and contain no motivational message. But they make those movies because our country has that kind of audience. What sharukh khan sir is doing? See his movies now and please give me one message from his today's movies which will motivate a single person. They make movies for entertainment only. Because in our country entertainment is serious business. In Hollywood people are more open minded and they like those concepts more than our country. They believe in researches more than us. That's why in there country movies with some deep concept raise more funds. This is because there audience. So, lets not fight on Bollywood and Hollywood. Stop watching movies of sunny and alia if we don't like. They will automatically come into these kind of movies.",

At any time, any class/section in power has been in control of the economy..this is still going on. Eg, congress and Bjp. Academicians and administrators have always been in the top rung in any country. I don't deny there have been periods of discriminative practices not just by brahmins but by all sections in power..kshatriyas, vaishyas and brahmins... Also, caste system was distorted into casteism by the black moles of the above mentioned castes...Earlier castes were not decided by birth but by role one played in the society eg - valmiki..it later became political power play to control one section. What is happening now is no different from what happened then. Also, brahmins now cannot be blamed for what happened then.",

Also, if you want to begin compensating for the social structural flaws of the past..then begin with the women who have suffered longer and more than all of you put together ..One whole GENDER controlled and exploited for AGES..and CENTURIES...Even basic human rights were not available...TILL DATE. So, how about compensating for the 50% of the population that has been suppressed for ages. HAS ANYONE DONE IT? No?

Why the hell are you guys not producing john nash' and einstien?

My advice is stop feeling vicitmised for what happened to one section that long back, and stop expecting apologies after so many centuries...This is the post modern world where modi's caste is irrelevant and he is our honourable prime minister and better than any other castes merely because of his deeds...The caste system was made with this same intention but got distorted along the way and there's no denying that.",

Ramachandra Rao, the district collector for Nellore and the secretary of the Indian Mathematical Society.[38][39][40] Ramachandra Rao was impressed by Ramanujan's research but doubted that it was actually his own work. Ramanujan mentioned a correspondence he had with Professor Saldhana, a notable Bombay mathematician, in which Saldhana expressed a lack of understanding of his work but concluded that he was not a phoney.[41] Ramanujan's friend, C. V. Rajagopalachari, persisted with Ramachandra Rao and tried to quell any doubts over Ramanujan's academic integrity. Rao agreed to give him another chance, and he listened as Ramanujan discussed elliptic integrals, hypergeometric series, and his theory of divergent series, which Rao said ultimately \"converted\" him to a belief in Ramanujan's mathematical brilliance.[41] When Rao asked him what he wanted, Ramanujan replied that he needed some work and financial support. Rao consented and sent him to Madras. He continued his mathematical research with Rao's financial aid taking care of his daily needs. Ramanujan, with the help of Ramaswamy Aiyer, had his work published in the Journal of the Indian Mathematical Society",

A lot of mathematics is beautiful because of the results pulled in from different areas and united to create an elegant series of logic. A lot of advanced mathematics actually involves proving extremely obvious things that all of us take for granted in answering questions like what a natural and real number are, and constructing number systems.",

I hope they also describe how mainstream treated him. I always thought of this person as a gift if only we could all be gifts to others",

        "commentText": "+Varoon Same! Coming from a fellow Hindu atheist. Religion is so much more than believing in God. Hinduism or Sanatan Dharma is a peace loving religion teaching respect and harmony, love for animals and such other good practices. The holy Hindu books are completely based on science and did not in any way promote spreading religion or conversion. Even the shlokas or Vedas constructed thousands of years ago contain scientific facts which are being discovered by present day scientists. There is so much to learn from this religion and God is a very small part of it. Religions such as Buddhism which also aim at enlightenment of the soul and holistic development and preach harmony stem from Hinduism.This all changed after Mughals came to India. The medieval era of India is dark because it was tainted by the inflow of these outsiders. They wiped out all the intellectual development that happened in this country before that and India became a poverty stricken illiterate country. If Hindus are still so trusting and gullible and believe that our benefit lies in this country being 'sickular', think again. But I admit it's difficult to let go of the values ingrained in us. We were raised with morals like 'atithi devo bhava' which also means 'the guest is equivalent to God'. It's high time these guests leave.",

He puts on a ridiculous accent in every movie he's in that feeds into a silly stereotype and looks always like he's on some uppers! Surely for this kind of a high profile project they could have got someone better to stand up alongside Irons and Fry? I hope I am proven wrong on both counts :(",

A lot of friends i know have already suffered that way, whether it was to escape studies, break ups....basically anything of that sort. I just use it to rest under starry skies at night .....something very calming bout it (with good music of course...and some good company)",

When i was a kid i was fascinated by hypnotism, so i had this book about self hypnosis and i got myself into a state of trance so it is totally possible to meditate on your own. why do we need a guru? well, when we were in school we had teachers to simplyfy things, they guided us through academics as we had zero knowledge about studies and they also disciplined us... likewise when some beginner meditates a lot of questions arise as he doesnt have an idea of what meditation actually is (trust me, meditation is one of the things that can only be known through experience), questions like am i doing it right? am i breathing right etc etc etc. all these questions can only be answered by a guru... Also i have seen people meditating on their own and coming to a conclusion that it only calms ones mind, which is just a part of it, meditation can do miraculous things. Gurus also help you work on a certain chakra like they help open it up and once its open you can access it any time you want while meditating... Also i have seen people just drifing away from this world in such a trance that it becomes hard to bring them into the normal conciousness (dont be scared you wont die but if your family finds you in such state you will be in trouble XD)... As quoted by sadhguru jaggi vasudev \"it is sensible to take instructions when you are in an unknown terrain\"",

Imagine what the world would be like if everyone had the same knowledge as them and revolutionary ideas as them. The world would be a much nicer place and the human race could be the most intelligent species in the entire universe if we all understood and applied their knowledge to the modern world. If all 7 billion of us were as smart and brilliant as them. No one knows what we could become in a couple decades from now. But yeah I'm definitely going to see this.",

        "commentText": "+kemi7689 The problem wasn't people believing or understanding him, in math you prove stuff, and when you are that much of a genius no one understands you, the problem was people not being welcoming of him or not taking too much interest in his works. Because he was self taught, you never knew if what ever thing he was using if he saw it somewhere, if he proved it somewhere, or if it was an unproven theorem. To this day this kind of problem happens when gigantic proofs arise because of the sheer size a mistake is bound to happen, specially when referencing other proofs. So the problem was that he needed people to verify his theorems, the sheer amount of work was intimidating for anyone, and the purpose of his work was vague, well, because he only cared about pure mathematics not necessarily eventual applications. He was like fermat, but without the rubbing of eventual interesting applications on people's faces or the gloating that would at least make people want to disprove or prove him. The reason someone took really good interest was the sheer amount of obscure mathematics he referenced and how they all weirdly came together. As one guy said \"if someone imagined this, it must be true\" because by no other means but reality someone could have imagined something so non-intuitive. And interestingly he was an easier proof than many like him, everything he conjectured (intentionally or not) has been proven true. His work was very odd, but not as hard to prove as one would have though looking at it, which makes me thankful he existed, He was one of the people that if he had not lived we wouldn't get anything like it so soon. And pretty much all he has done is absurdly useful, it's like he invented the electrical engine in the iron age and in a way that wasn't all that hard to reproduce or verify.",

Ppl were not interested in movies like tht which pretty much shows wht the majority of the demography want to watch. I did not specifically say tht u don't watch movies like this, I said that the reason y u did not know about the movie is bcz the other ppl don't wanna watch movies such as these. It would be senseless fr bollywood to make a movie on his life bcz the language will kill the honesty of the story. Since his life is majorly based in chennai and UK, hindi will not be practical.",

Also, those of upper classes or those that displayed exceptional talents, (such as in this case) from Britain's colonies regularly studied in England, and would return home after. It was hardly ever for permanent settlement, and never in droves of randoms unlike in the case of these migrants. It may understandably come off that way to some people, but I think the timing is coincidental.

Will: Beethoven, okay. He looked at a piano, and it just made sense to him. He could just play. Skylar: So what are you saying? You play the piano? Will: No, not a lick. I mean, I look at a piano, I see a bunch of keys, three pedals, and a box of wood. But Beethoven, Mozart, they saw it, they could just play. I couldn't paint you a picture, I probably can't hit the ball out of Fenway, and I can't play the piano. Skylar: But you can do my o-chem paper in under an hour. Will: Right.

As it was, some religious scientists were killed for discovering/promoting science that went against the dominant religion. Sure, in some cases religions have been ok with science...in many other cases, they haven't. Just look at YEC/LC Christian sects/organizations and several Islam sects waging war on evolution right now. Or their attacks on stem cell research. Any scientific advancement/discovery/fact that goes against anyone's religious dogmas,are invariably attacked as evil and against their God(s).",

It should be said that cultures that held the status of Christianity, Islam, Judaism etc were advanced for their time rather than Idol worshipers or Animistic faiths. However, my argument is fueled by the fact that very early spiritual exploration and religious activities brought Mankind out of it's cycle of Eat, Sleep repeat. Considering with all the spare time that was brought upon by the Agricultural Revolution (you could also say that was a cause), people created faith to reason with things they didn't know worked. As time advanced, people kept their curiosity high enough so they started experimenting or doing math. Maybe in the modern world, Religion may set people back, but you can't deny that It was a major catalyst for our modern world.",

The Arabs recovered many Greek texts that would've been counter-intuitive to what Islam says and despite it, they still did so and the collective Ummah had no problem with it. Confucian China purposely told people to go out and discover what the world had to offer w/o any means off attributing it to any divinity, and the Catholic Pope today even is in support of climate change research. And stem cell research ethics goes beyond religion, many irreligious people are against it as well; you can't put correlation to causation that it's religion that makes people against stem cell.

You're not reading it for what I actually wrote. \" Confucian China purposely told people to go out and discover what the world had to offer w/o any means off attributing it to any divinity,\" Yep. No God(s) required to pursue understanding the world. Thank you for supporting my initial comment. \"And as far as evolution goes, it's still just a theory \" A scientific theory, which all empirical evidence supports and none refutes. If you have any empirical evidence something in the theory of evolution is false, please share it. I would like to win a Nobel prize in biology. \"and one that entropy would debunk and falsify easily in most cases\" No, it doesn't. Not sure why you would think so other than not having any actual understanding of biology...and very likely misinformed by your religion. Even though the entire universe is in a state of entropy, we are not - as the sun injects more energy into our planetary system than we use up. \"Darwin himself died without fully proving it.\" Yep. Then we proved it. And we use it in numerous aspects of our lives. \"You're literally twisting history for sake of argument and need to stop.\" You have that backwards. Everything I said is accurate. You cite the current Pope's support for global warming. He also supports evolution. He doesn't support promoting condoms as a prevention of STDs. He doesn't support stem cell research. Why do you ignore these facts?",

The dumb ugly shit in question is indeed, a Brit-Indian... oh and FYI, right on top of Harrow-On-The-Hill (NW London), is a tiny 0.5 mile radius area where the Private School is also situated. That festering caviar pit of a hole, is considered the last remaining \"semi-decent\" part of Harrow where the also, last remaining Posh White Toff's of Harrow, now remain. Such a sad story really - as they've been left with no other choice than to inbreed, more often than not, with force - hardcore style :O. The entire rest of Harrow is a steaming pile of cat shit. Actually come to think of it, as you speak so highly of that dump of an area, you are probably from there too, and, well are stuck with all the Eastern Euro's, Somali's and I dunno (nor care), Mongols?? who inhabit around 80+% of those parts now. Not that I'm complaining, they have boosted my business by 250% easy. Dumb ass, don't share/comment from here on out, esp if you're only here to troll... simple just gtfo of YT... please? xoxo p.s: and Alt+F4 your life while you're at it.",

You know what else is a good one? \"Film release date\", this is a bit different from \"Date trailer was uploaded on YouTube\", if you look for the release date of this movie, you will find some film festival showings last year, as well as a really sketchy official release date later this year. On the other hand, the \"Date trailer was uploaded on YouTube\" is like, today. Anyway, good luck in learning new phrases, the world of terminologies is a weird one, xD TL;DR make better arguments next time",
