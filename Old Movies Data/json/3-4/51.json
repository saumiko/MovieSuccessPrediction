It is really really bad, if im going to watch some low budget stupid movie, i would rather watch something like \"a haunted house\", at least it is funny u know!",

I remember back when Blair Witch first came out, and I thought it was meant to be real, and that was the only thing would have been scary about it. Then I heard that it was fake and \"made to look like it was real,\" and I was like \"huh? why would you do that? what's the point?\" Found footage movies are based on this really idiotic premise that \"you are now seeing people in the \"footage\" who are acting scared. Therefore it is now your cue to be scared.\" Yes, thanks for letting me know. A scary film ought to scare you of its own virtue, not because there are scared people in it. And they just keep churning them out like this spreading disease, enough of this crap. At least if they gave them their own genre and it wasn't advertised as horror but rather as \"found footage horror\" so you'd know to avoid it.",

You people are fucking retarded. If the government genuinely wanted all this information to be hidden I'm pretty sure that they could keep it hidden. At this point in time pretty much everyone and their mother thinks that the government hides extraterrestrials and knows everything about them, and yet if it were true I'm pretty sure they'd have done a better job of keeping this shit secret.",

Maybe one hot girl and a nerdy girl and a fat guy. But not 3 hot girls. Most hot girls don't even have the attention span to look up in the sky, they are too busy taking selfies...and hanging out at someone's VIP table and playing with their lap dogs, when not getting wasted or doing modeling gigs, vip cocktailing or stripping. I live in Vegas... I know a ton of hot girls they are rarely into this stuff and get 3 of them together and the last thing they are going to do is take off and go to Aria 51... Unless maybe you have some coke and some weed LOL I wish it was different but that's the reality of Vegas. The Radio Show Scene is where you lost me. It looks like a panel for the AVN porn convention. It looks like a UFO meets Blair Witch docudrama. I hope the writer/Director and Producer got laid a lot for sacrificing the integrity of the movie with the casting/makeup/wardrobe choices. Or go back and film the sex scenes so you can release it at AVN...lol But at least you need to re-cut this trailer to reflect why you would have 3 hot girls going on a UFO investigation, or was a party road trip and you stumbled into area 51. It just does not look right as it is. But props to all involved for making an effort as making any movie is a ton of work for all involved so I wish you all of them the best. Which is why I have tried to be detailed and constructive with my criticism.",

Filming this was fun in that respect. As for the selfies, lap dogs, and marijuana.....you nailed it...It was very stressful trying to get the film shot due to those 3 things. It was definitely a 4 month process, but I believe you miss the premise of the story....We are college students 2 male horn dogs...of course we want sexy women to go on the trip with us, they aren't in it for the interest of the information. They come along because they think it will be a fun party time, and because there will be booze and drugs (because as we both agree they are, in fact, just pretty girls that like to have fun.) Which, in turn, if you were to read the script, or see the feature, you'll realize as to how we manage to get into harms way. It's not because Mike, who is the one taking all of this seriously...it happens because the girls don't find that any of it is as serious as Mike takes and nonchalantly throws caution to the wind. Sorry for the long post, the story is just much more intricate and detailed, and I feel as though you may not have fully conceptualized each characters breakdown and place in the storyline.",
